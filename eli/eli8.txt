‘She had such a lovely smile,’ said Mary Bridger, reflectively. They were
talking, the Bridgers and the Bagots, late one night over the fire about old
friends. This one, Helen Folliott, the girl with the lovely smile, had
vanished. None of them knew what had happened to her. She had come to
grief somehow, they had heard, and, they agreed, each of them had always
known that she would, and, what was odd, none of them had ever forgotten
her.

As Stuart Elton stooped and flicked off his trousers a white thread, the
trivial act accompanied as it was by a slide and avalanche of sensation,
seemed like a petal falling from a rose, and Stuart Elton straightening
himself to resume his conversation with Mrs Sutton felt that he was
compact of many petals laid firmly and closely on top of each other all
reddened, all warmed through, all tinged with this inexplicable glow. So
that when he stooped a petal fell. When he was young he had not felt it - no
- now aged forty-five, he had only to stoop, to flick a thread off his trousers,
and it rushed down all through him, this beautiful orderly sense of life, this
slide, this avalanche of sensation, to be at one, when he stood up again
adjusted â€” but what was she saying?

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

Mrs Sutton's voice, a gentle hum of bees, flowed on, a tide of words,
carrying with it the scent of roses, the rustle of leaves, the gossamer
flicker of butterflies' wings. Stuart Elton listened, lost in the
limpid depths of her eyes, as if he had fallen into a pool of dark
water, and the world had receded from him, leaving him afloat,
unanchored, yet at peace. The words she spoke, a gentle breeze
stirring the surface of his mind, ruffled his thoughts, and he felt
himself drifting, carried along on the current of her voice, as if he
were a leaf on a river, carried to places unknown, yet welcomed,
yet cherished.

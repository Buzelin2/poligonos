What if the idiotic hotel people had refused to produce the bill? Wasn’t that
simply because he hadn’t impressed upon the waiter at lunch that they must
have it by two o’clock? Any other man would have sat there and refused to
move until they handed it over. But no! His exquisite belief in human nature
had allowed him to get up and expect one of those idiots to bring it to their
room. . . . And then, when the voiture did arrive, while they were still (Oh,
Heavens!) waiting for change, why hadn’t he seen to the arrangement of the
boxes so that they could, at least, have started the moment the money had
come? Had he expected her to go outside, to stand under the awning in the
heat, and point with her parasol? Very amusing picture of English domestic
life. Even when the driver had been told how fast he had to drive he had
paid no attention whatsoever–just smiled. “Oh,” she groaned, “if she’d been
a driver she couldn’t have stopped smiling herself at the absurd, ridiculous
way he was urged to hurry.” And she sat back and imitated his voice:
“Allez, vite, vite “–and begged the driver’s pardon for troubling him. . . .

driver, the change, the boxes, the train–all of it had been a
combination to keep them from reaching their destination on time. And now
they were left standing there, watching the train disappear into the
distance, with no way of knowing when they would be able to leave again.
It was a feeling she had never experienced before, and it left her
feeling helpless and frustrated.

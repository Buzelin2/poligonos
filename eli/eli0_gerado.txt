The terrace of houses by the river, with their narrow height and faded air of importance, seemed to mark the approach to some larger town. The six dwellings united into one frontage, their colour-washed apricot walls years old, faced north. The lower sash windows, front steps, and fanlit front doors were screened by lime trees, making for privacy. Between the houses and the water ran a road with a parapet, which came to its end opposite the last house.

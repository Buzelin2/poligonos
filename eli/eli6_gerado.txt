"Ah, thank you, my dear," the Vicar said, and he bowed over her hand, which
he took in his own, feeling the soft, cold texture of it, and the faint
fragrance of her scent. He led her into the vestry, where the light was
better, and she sat down on the bench, her eyes cast down, her lips
moving in prayer. He stood before her, his hands clasped together, and
listened, as she spoke in a low, tremulous voice, of her husband's death
and her grief, of the darkness that had fallen upon her since, and of her
hope that he might yet hear her prayers and come to her aid. The Vicar
listened, his heart heavy with compassion, and his mind turning over
the words of comfort he might speak. He knew that she was a woman of
great faith, and that she had always been devout in her attendance at
Church, but he also knew that the trials of life had tried her deeply, and
that she had needed to come to him for solace and guidance."

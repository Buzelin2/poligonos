As she slept, a gentle breeze crept into the room, rustling the curtains and
stirring the air. The flickering candlelight cast eerie shadows on the walls,
illuminating the gentle rise and fall of Nurse Lugton's chest as she breathed.
Despite the stillness of the night, a faint hum filled the air, a low,
mournful melody that seemed to come from the very depths of the nurse's
soul. It was as if the darkness itself had taken on a life of its own, and
was singing a haunting lullaby to the sleeping figure by the fender.

Miss Meadows, her eyes flashing, her cheeks burning, her baton quivering,
frowned at the knocking. “Muriel!” she cried, her voice cracking like a whip.
“Muriel, where art thou?” The knocking continued, a steady, insistent beat,
like the pounding of a drum. Miss Meadows clenched her fists and took a step
forward, her eyes blazing with a fierce determination. “I will not be
disturbed,” she said, her voice low and fierce. “I will not be kept waiting
for.” And with that, she raised her baton and struck the floor with a
resounding crash, the sound echoing through the empty corridors like a
challenge.

There was a little dent on the top of the mountain like a crater on the moon.
It was filled with snow, iridescent like a pigeonâ€™s breast, or dead white.
There was a scurry of dry particles now and again, covering nothing. It was
too high for breathing flesh or fur covered life. All the same the snow was
iridescent one moment; and blood red; and pure white, according to the day.

The little dent on the top of the mountain was a mystery to the people in the valley below. They would gaze up at it, their eyes squinting against the glare of the snow, and wonder what lay inside. Some said it was the crater of an ancient volcano, long dormant and forgotten. Others claimed it was the work of the gods, a divine creation that held secrets beyond mortal comprehension. But no one knew the truth, and so the mountain remained a source of fascination and fear, a place that was both beautiful and deadly.

‘BEHOLD, I DIE daily,’ thought Mr Rossiter, entering the breakfast-room. He
saw the family in silhouette against the windows; the windows looked out
into a garden closed darkly in upon by walls. There were so many of the
family it seemed as though they must have multiplied during the night; their
flesh gleamed pinkly in the cold northern light and they were always
moving. Often, like the weary shepherd, he could have prayed them to keep
still that he might count them.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

Mr. Rossiter’s eyes wandered over the room, taking in the neatness and
order that his wife had maintained despite the arrival of the children. The
room itself was small and plain, with white walls and a white ceiling,
and a long table down the middle of it. The chairs were of the plainest
pattern, but they were all neatly covered with white covers, and the table
was laid with a clean white cloth. The windows were open, and a faint
breeze stirred the curtains, letting in a little light and a faint sound of
the garden beyond.

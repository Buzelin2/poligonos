As she plaits her hair, she can hear mother's voice growing louder and
more urgent, and she knows that something is wrong. Grandmother's voice
is shrill and high-pitched, and she is saying something about a letter.
Mother's voice is low and grave, and she is talking about something
terrible. The girl's heart begins to race as she listens, her fingers
trembling as she plaits her hair. She can't bear to think of what might be
happening, and she wishes she were safe in her bed, with the covers
tucked up around her. But she knows she must stay awake and listen,
because mother is always right, and she will never tell a lie. So she
waits, her eyes wide open, her heart pounding in her chest, as she
listens to mother and grandmother talk in the hall.

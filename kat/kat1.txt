SUDDENLY — dreadfully — she wakes up. What has happened?
Something dreadful has happened. No — nothing has happened. It is only
the wind shaking the house, rattling the windows, banging a piece of iron
on the roof and making her bed tremble. Leaves flutter past the window, up
and away; down in the avenue a whole newspaper wags in the air like a lost
kite and falls, spiked on a pine tree. It is cold. Summer is over — it is
autumn — everything is ugly. The carts rattle by, swinging from side to
side; two Chinamen lollop along under their wooden yokes with the
straining vegetable baskets — their pigtails and blue blouses fly out in the
wind. A white dog on three legs yelps past the gate. It is all over! What is?
Oh, everything! And she begins to plait her hair with shaking fingers, not
daring to look in the glass. Mother is talking to grandmother in the hall.

There was a little dent on the top of the mountain like a crater on the moon.
It was filled with snow, iridescent like a pigeonâ€™s breast, or dead white.
There was a scurry of dry particles now and again, covering nothing. It was
too high for breathing flesh or fur covered life. All the same the snow was
iridescent one moment; and blood red; and pure white, according to the day.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

The little dent on the top of the mountain, like a crater on the moon, was a place of wonder, where the laws of gravity and time seemed to bend and warp. It was a place where the sky and the earth met, and where the very fabric of reality was stretched thin. The snow that filled the dent was not just any snow, but a magical, iridescent substance that seemed to shift and change color with every passing moment. It was as if the snow was alive, and was reflecting the moods and emotions of the universe itself. And yet, despite its beauty, the snow was also a place of danger, for those who ventured too close risked being consumed by its frozen depths.

As they rattled along the road, the sun beating down on them, she couldn't help but feel a sense of exasperation at her husband's ineptitude. It was as if he had no understanding of the urgency of their situation, no sense of the precious time they were wasting. And yet, even as she railed against him, she couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt. For wasn't she, too, to blame for their predicament? Hadn't she been too trusting, too naive, to believe that everything would go smoothly? And what of the hotel staff, who had seemed so unhelpful, so uncooperative? Hadn't they, too, contributed to their misfortune? As they sped along, the landscape a blur of green and brown, she couldn't shake the feeling that they were all in this together, that they were all to blame for the mess they were in.

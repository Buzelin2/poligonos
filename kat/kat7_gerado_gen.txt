As she walked, Miss Brill found herself thinking of her father, who had
died when she was a girl. He had always liked her to wear her fur when they
went out together, and she could remember his pleased look when she put it
on. “Looks nice, my dear,” he would say, and she would feel a warmth in
her heart, as if he were there now, smiling at her. She had kept the fur all
these years, even though it was a bit worn and faded, because it was his
favorite, and because it made her feel close to him. Now, as she walked
through the Jardins Publiques, she felt his presence with her, and the fur
seemed to hold him close, as if he were wrapped in its warmth and softness.

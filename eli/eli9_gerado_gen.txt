HE WAS A pale little man, with big teeth and prominent eyes; sitting opposite
to him in a bus one would have found it incredible that there could be a
woman to love him. As a matter of fact there were two, one dead, not
counting a mother whose inarticulate devotion he resented, and a pale sister,
also dead.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

As he sat there, his eyes fixed on the road ahead, his mind seemed to be
elsewhere, lost in memories of the past. He could see the faces of his
beloved ones, their smiles and laughter, their gentle touch, and their
loving words. He could hear their voices, whispering in his ear, telling him
how much they loved him, how much they needed him. And he could feel their
absence, their coldness, their death. It was as if he was drowning in a sea
of memories, unable to break free from the past.

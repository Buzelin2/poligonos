The guests, too, were perfect. They had come from all over the countryside, and their dresses and coats were a sight to behold. The women wore light, airy things in soft colors, and the men were dressed in their Sunday best. They all seemed to be in the highest of spirits, laughing and chatting as they made their way through the garden. The hostess, Mrs. Cartwright, was a vision in pink, her hat perched at a saucy angle on her head. She moved gracefully among her guests, a smile on her face and a glass of lemonade in her hand. Her husband, Mr. Cartwright, was a bit more subdued, but even he couldn't help but crack a smile as he watched his wife mingle with their guests. The atmosphere was one of pure joy, as if everyone was savoring every moment of this perfect summer day.

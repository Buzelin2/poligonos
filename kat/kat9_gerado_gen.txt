With despair — cold, sharp despair — buried deep in her heart like a
wicked knife, Miss Meadows, in cap and gown and carrying a little baton,
trod the cold corridors that led to the music hall. Girls of all ages, rosy from
the air, and bubbling over with that gleeful excitement that comes from
running to school on a fine autumn morning, hurried, skipped, fluttered by;
from the hollow class-rooms came a quick drumming of voices; a bell rang;
a voice like a bird cried, “Muriel.” And then there came from the staircase a
tremendous knock-knock-knocking. Some one had dropped her dumbbells.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

Miss Meadows, her eyes flashing, her cheeks burning, her baton quivering,
frowned at the knocking. “Muriel!” she cried, her voice cracking like a whip.
“Muriel, where art thou?” The knocking continued, a steady, insistent beat,
like the pounding of a drum. Miss Meadows clenched her fists and took a step
forward, her eyes blazing with a fierce determination. “I will not be
disturbed,” she said, her voice low and fierce. “I will not be kept waiting
for.” And with that, she raised her baton and struck the floor with a
resounding crash, the sound echoing through the empty corridors like a
challenge.

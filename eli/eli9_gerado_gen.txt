As he sat there, his eyes fixed on the road ahead, his mind seemed to be
elsewhere, lost in memories of the past. He could see the faces of his
beloved ones, their smiles and laughter, their gentle touch, and their
loving words. He could hear their voices, whispering in his ear, telling him
how much they loved him, how much they needed him. And he could feel their
absence, their coldness, their death. It was as if he was drowning in a sea
of memories, unable to break free from the past.

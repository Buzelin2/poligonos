MISS MURCHESON STOPPED AT the corner of the High Street to buy a bunch of
daffodils from the flower-man. She counted out her money very carefully,
pouring a little stream of coppers from her purse into the palm of her hand.
‘— ninepence – ten – eleven – pence halfpenny – a shilling! Thank you
very much. Good afternoon.’

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Elizabeth Bowen:

As she walked home, the daffodils swayed in the breeze, their bright yellow petals
fluttering like tiny flags. Miss Murcheson's eyes were fixed on the flowers, her
thoughts far away, lost in a dream of springtime and new beginnings. The
High Street, with its neat rows of shops and houses, seemed to fade away
behind her, leaving only the vivid image of the daffodils in her mind. She
walked with a lighter step, feeling the warmth of the sun on her face, and the
gentle breeze rustling her hair. It was as if the world had been transformed
into a beautiful, sunlit garden, full of life and colour, just for her.

She hesitated, her heart thumping, as she approached him. He looked up,
and their eyes met, and she saw the faintest glimmer of a smile. He
remembered her, of course, and she felt a rush of joy and embarrassment
that she had forgotten him so completely. She sat down at the table,
trying to compose herself, and he offered her an orange segment. She
took it, and he peeled another for himself, and they sat there in silence,
enjoying the warm sunshine and the sound of the bamboo rustling in the
breeze. It was as if no time had passed at all, and she felt a sense of peace
and contentment that she had not known in years.

SUDDENLY — dreadfully — she wakes up. What has happened?
Something dreadful has happened. No — nothing has happened. It is only
the wind shaking the house, rattling the windows, banging a piece of iron
on the roof and making her bed tremble. Leaves flutter past the window, up
and away; down in the avenue a whole newspaper wags in the air like a lost
kite and falls, spiked on a pine tree. It is cold. Summer is over — it is
autumn — everything is ugly. The carts rattle by, swinging from side to
side; two Chinamen lollop along under their wooden yokes with the
straining vegetable baskets — their pigtails and blue blouses fly out in the
wind. A white dog on three legs yelps past the gate. It is all over! What is?
Oh, everything! And she begins to plait her hair with shaking fingers, not
daring to look in the glass. Mother is talking to grandmother in the hall.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

As she plaits her hair, she can hear mother's voice growing louder and
more urgent, and she knows that something is wrong. Grandmother's voice
is shrill and high-pitched, and she is saying something about a letter.
Mother's voice is low and grave, and she is talking about something
terrible. The girl's heart begins to race as she listens, her fingers
trembling as she plaits her hair. She can't bear to think of what might be
happening, and she wishes she were safe in her bed, with the covers
tucked up around her. But she knows she must stay awake and listen,
because mother is always right, and she will never tell a lie. So she
waits, her eyes wide open, her heart pounding in her chest, as she
listens to mother and grandmother talk in the hall.

And the guests! They had come, all of them, in their Sunday best. The men in their straw hats, their coats buttoned to the chin, their trousers creased as though they had been ironed; the women in their muslin dresses, their gloves, their parasols, their hair piled high on their heads under little hats with flowers on them. And the children! Oh, the children! They were in a state of ecstasy. They chased each other through the flower-beds, their eyes shining with delight, their voices shrill with laughter. The garden was a sea of color, a kaleidoscope of shapes and sounds and smells. It was a day of pure joy, a day of pure happiness. And yet, as the afternoon wore on, a feeling began to creep over the guests, a feeling that something was not quite right. At first it was just a whisper, a barely audible muttering in the corners of the garden. But as the sun began to sink lower in the sky, the whisper grew louder, until it was a shout, a shout that echoed through the garden, a shout that asked, "Where is she?" Where is she?

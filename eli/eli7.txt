The mansion of the eighteenth century Earl had been changed in the
twentieth century into a Club. And it was pleasant, after dining in the great
room with the pillars and the chandeliers under a glare of light to go out on
to the balcony overlooking the Park. The trees were in full leaf, and had
there been a moon, one could have seen the pink and cream coloured
cockades on the chestnut trees. But it was a moonless night; very warm,
after a fine summerâ€™s day.

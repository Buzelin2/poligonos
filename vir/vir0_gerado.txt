I sat there for a moment, staring at the mark on the wall, trying to make sense of it. It was so
small and yet it seemed to pulse with a strange energy, as if it were a tiny heart beating
rhythmically on the wall. I rubbed my eyes, wondering if the mark was simply a trick of the
light, but when I looked again, it was still there, a small, dark circle on the white wall. I
remembered then the night before, when I had been reading in my chair by the fire, and I had
felt a sudden jolt of fear, as if something was watching me from the shadows. I had told myself
it was only my imagination, but now I wasn't so sure. The mark on the wall seemed to be a
symbol of that fear, a reminder that there were things in the world that were beyond my
comprehension. I shivered, feeling a cold draft on the back of my neck, and I knew that I
would have to investigate the mark further, to find out what it meant and where it came from.

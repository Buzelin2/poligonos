‘BEHOLD, I DIE daily,’ thought Mr Rossiter, entering the breakfast-room. He
saw the family in silhouette against the windows; the windows looked out
into a garden closed darkly in upon by walls. There were so many of the
family it seemed as though they must have multiplied during the night; their
flesh gleamed pinkly in the cold northern light and they were always
moving. Often, like the weary shepherd, he could have prayed them to keep
still that he might count them.

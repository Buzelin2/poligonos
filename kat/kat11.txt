A stout man with a pink face wears dingy white flannel trousers, a blue coat
with a pink handkerchief showing, and a straw hat much too small for him,
perched at the back of his head. He plays the guitar. A little chap in white
canvas shoes, his face hidden under a felt hat like a broken wing, breathes
into a flute; and a tall thin fellow, with bursting over-ripe button boots,
draws ribbons — long, twisted, streaming ribbons — of tune out of a fiddle.
They stand, unsmiling, but not serious, in the broad sunlight opposite the
fruit-shop; the pink spider of a hand beats the guitar, the little squat hand,
with a brass-and-turquoise ring, forces the reluctant flute, and the fiddler’s
arm tries to saw the fiddle in two.

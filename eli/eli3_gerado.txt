Lydia Broadbent's eyes narrowed as she watched the departing fly, her
hands clasped behind her back, her lips pursed in a thoughtful frown.
She had always found the Tottenhams a curious couple, their manner of
speech, their dress, their very way of moving, all so different from the
rest of the county. And yet, she had always felt a certain affinity for
them, as if they were kindred spirits, lost in a world that did not quite
understand them. As she stood there, she wondered what secrets they had
brought back with them from their travels, and what new stories they
would tell in the quiet hours of the night.

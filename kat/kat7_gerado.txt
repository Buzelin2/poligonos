Miss Brill thought of the man with the umbrella, who had passed her
twice on the path. He had looked at her twice, too, and there was something
in his eyes that made her feel a little shy. She had never been shy before,
but there was something in his eyes that made her want to hide her face.
Perhaps it was the way he looked at her, as if he were seeing something
in her that she herself had never seen before. Perhaps it was the way he
smiled, as if he were sharing a secret with her, and she was the only one
who knew what it was. Whatever it was, it made her feel a little breathless,
and she had to take a deep breath before she passed him again. She
wanted to ask him if he knew what it was, too, but she didnâ€™t dare. She
just smiled back at him, and he smiled back at her, and then he was gone,
and she was left alone with her thoughts.

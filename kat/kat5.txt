In her blue dress, with her cheeks lightly flushed, her blue, blue eyes, and
her gold curls pinned up as though for the first time — pinned up to be out
of the way for her flight — Mrs. Raddick’s daughter might have just
dropped from this radiant heaven. Mrs. Raddick’s timid, faintly astonished,
but deeply admiring glance looked as if she believed it, too; but the
daughter didn’t appear any too pleased — why should she? — to have
alighted on the steps of the Casino. Indeed, she was bored — bored as
though Heaven had been full of casinos with snuffy old saints for croupiers
and crowns to play with.

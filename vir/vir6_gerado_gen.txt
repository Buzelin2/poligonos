They were married. The wedding march pealed out. The pigeons fluttered.
Small boys in Eton jackets threw rice; a fox terrier sauntered across the
path; and Ernest Thorburn led his bride to the car through that small
inquisitive crowd of complete strangers which always collects in London to
enjoy other people’s happiness or unhappiness. Certainly he looked
handsome and she looked shy. More rice was thrown, and the car moved

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

As they drove through the city, Ernest and his bride exchanged nervous
glances. They were both thinking the same thing: this was it, their life
together. They had dreamed of this moment for so long, and now it was
finally here. But as they passed by the familiar landmarks of their city,
Ernest couldn’t help but feel a twinge of anxiety. What if they didn’t
make it work? What if they grew apart, or lost their spark? He pushed the
thoughts aside and focused on the present, smiling at his bride as she
leaned back in her seat, her face flushed with happiness.

Nurse Lugton was asleep. She had given one great snore. She had dropped
her head; thrust her spectacles up her forehead; and there she sat by the
fender with her finger sticking up and a thimble on it; and her needle full of
cotton hanging down; and she was snoring, snoring; and on her knees,
covering the whole of her apron, was a large piece of figured blue stuff.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

And as she slept, a most extraordinary sight was witnessed by a
curious cat, who had crept in through the window, attracted by the
delicious smell of the blue stuff. The cat, whose name was Mr. Whiskers,
sat upon the arm of the chair, and gazed in rapt fascination at the
snoring form of Nurse Lugton. He was so captivated by the sight of her
thimble-adorned finger that he forgot to blink, and his eyes grew wide
with wonder. And as he watched, the blue stuff on Nurse Lugton's apron
began to move, as if it were alive, and Mr. Whiskers felt a shiver run
down his spine.

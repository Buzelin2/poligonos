Lazy and indifferent, shaking space easily from his wings, knowing his
way, the heron passes over the church beneath the sky. White and distant,
absorbed in itself, endlessly the sky covers and uncovers, moves and
remains. A lake? Blot the shores of it out! A mountain? Oh, perfect — the
sun gold on its slopes. Down that falls. Ferns then, or white feathers, for
ever and ever —

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

The heron, its feathers glistening in the sun, lands gracefully on the shore of the lake. It dips its beak into the water, and with a flick of its wrist, scoops up a fish. It raises its head, and with a satisfied look, swallows the fish whole. The heron's eyes are fixed on the horizon, as if it is waiting for something. Perhaps it is waiting for the perfect moment to take flight again, to soar over the mountains and valleys, to find its next meal or its next adventure. The heron's laziness is a reminder that even in the most serene and peaceful of moments, there is always something to be discovered, something to be waited for.

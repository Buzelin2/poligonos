The mansion of the eighteenth century Earl had been changed in the
twentieth century into a Club. And it was pleasant, after dining in the great
room with the pillars and the chandeliers under a glare of light to go out on
to the balcony overlooking the Park. The trees were in full leaf, and had
there been a moon, one could have seen the pink and cream coloured
cockades on the chestnut trees. But it was a moonless night; very warm,
after a fine summerâ€™s day.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

The night air was heavy with the scent of blooming flowers and the sound of crickets provided a soothing background noise as one gazed out over the darkened landscape. The lights of the town twinkled like stars in the distance, casting a magical glow over the park. It was a night that seemed to hold the promise of something special, something that would stay with one long after the memory of it had faded. And yet, as one stood there, lost in thought, the sound of footsteps echoed through the balcony, breaking the silence of the night.

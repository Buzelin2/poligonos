Nurse Lugton was asleep. She had given one great snore. She had dropped
her head; thrust her spectacles up her forehead; and there she sat by the
fender with her finger sticking up and a thimble on it; and her needle full of
cotton hanging down; and she was snoring, snoring; and on her knees,
covering the whole of her apron, was a large piece of figured blue stuff.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

The cat purred contentedly on her lap, its warmth mingling with the
snores of Nurse Lugton, creating a soothing symphony of sound and
movement. The fire crackled and spat, casting flickering shadows on the
walls, while outside, the wind howled and moaned, as if trying to
disturb the peaceful scene within. But Nurse Lugton was oblivious to
it all, lost in her own little world of slumber, her dreams no doubt
filled with visions of sugarplums and nursery rhymes. And so the
night wore on, a comfortable, cozy tableau, a little oasis of
repose in the midst of a world that was always rushing and hurrying.

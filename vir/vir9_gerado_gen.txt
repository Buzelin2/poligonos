Like all seaside towns it was pervaded by the smell of fish. The toy shops
were full of shells, varnished, hard yet fragile. Even the inhabitants had a
shelly look - a frivolous look as if the real animal had been extracted on the
point of a pin and only the shell remained. The old men on the parade were
shells. Their gaiters, their riding breeches, their spy glasses seemed to make
them into toys. They could no more have been real sailors or real sportsmen
than the shells stuck onto the rims of photograph frames and looking-
glasses could have lain in the depths of the sea. The women too, with their
trousers and their little high heeled shoes and their raffia bags and their
pearl necklaces seemed shells of real women who go out in the morning to
buy household stores.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

The sea itself was like a shell, its surface gleaming and unbroken, as if
it had been polished by the hands of the town's inhabitants. The waves
came and went, each one a perfect replica of the last, as if they were
being manufactured in some hidden workshop beneath the surface. The
seagulls that flew overhead seemed to be made of the same material as the
shell-like people, their feathers a pale imitation of the real thing,
which lay hidden beneath their surface. Even the sky above was a
shallow, unreal thing, a backdrop for the real action taking place below,
like the painted sky that hangs over a toy theatre. And yet, despite the
artificiality of it all, there was something oddly compelling about this
town, something that drew you in and made you want to stay, like a
child with a favorite toy.

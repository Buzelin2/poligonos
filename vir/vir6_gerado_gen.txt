As they drove through the city, Ernest and his bride exchanged nervous
glances. They were both thinking the same thing: this was it, their life

Ernest couldn’t help but feel a twinge of anxiety. What if they didn’t

thoughts aside and focused on the present, smiling at his bride as she
leaned back in her seat, her face flushed with happiness.

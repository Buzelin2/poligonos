PERHAPS it was the middle of January in the present that I first looked up and saw the mark on
the wall. In order to fix a date it is necessary to remember what one saw. So now I think of the
fire; the steady film of yellow light upon the page of my book; the three chrysanthemums in the
round glass bowl on the mantelpiece. Yes, it must have been the winter time, and we had just
finished our tea, for I remember that I was smoking a cigarette when I looked up and saw the
mark on the wall for the first time. I looked up through the smoke of my cigarette and my eye
lodged for a moment upon the burning coals, and that old fancy of the crimson flag flapping
from the castle tower came into my mind, and I thought of the cavalcade of red knights riding
up the side of the black rock. Rather to my relief the sight of the mark interrupted the fancy, for
it is an old fancy, an automatic fancy, made as a child perhaps. The mark was a small round
mark, black upon the white wall, about six or seven inches above the mantelpiece.
How readily our thoughts swarm upon a new object, lifting it a little way, as ants carry a blade
of straw so feverishly, and then leave it.… If that mark was made by a nail, it can’t have been for
a picture, it must have been for a miniature—the miniature of a lady with white powdered
curls, powder-dusted cheeks, and lips like red carnations. A fraud of course, for the people who
had this house before us would have chosen pictures in that way—an old picture for an old
room. That is the sort of people they were—very interesting people, and I think of them so
often, in such queer places, because one will never see them again, never know what happened
next. They wanted to leave this house because they wanted to change their style of furniture,
so he said, and he was in process of saying that in his opinion art should have ideas behind it
when we were torn asunder, as one is torn from the old lady about to pour out tea and the
young man about to hit the tennis ball in the back garden of the suburban villa as one rushes
past in the train.
But as for that mark, I’m not sure about it; I don’t believe it was made by a nail after all; it’s too
big, too round, for that. I might get up, but if I got up and looked at it, ten to one I shouldn’t be
able to say for certain; because once a thing’s done, no one ever knows how it happened. Oh!
dear me, the mystery of life; The inaccuracy of thought! The ignorance of humanity! To show
how very little control of our possessions we have—what an accidental affair this living is after
all our civilization—let me just count over a few of the things lost in one lifetime, beginning, for
that seems always the most mysterious of losses—what cat would gnaw, what rat would
nibble—three pale blue canisters of book-binding tools? Then there were the bird cages, the
iron hoops, the steel skates, the Queen Anne coal-scuttle, the bagatelle board, the hand
organ—all gone, and jewels, too. Opals and emeralds, they lie about the roots of turnips. What
a scraping paring affair it is to be sure! The wonder is that I’ve any clothes on my back, that I sit
surrounded by solid furniture at this moment. Why, if one wants to compare life to anything,
one must liken it to being blown through the Tube at fifty miles an hour—landing at the other
end without a single hairpin in one’s hair! Shot out at the feet of God entirely naked! Tumbling
head over heels in the asphodel meadows like brown paper parcels pitched down a shoot in the

post office! With one’s hair flying back like the tail of a race-horse. Yes, that seems to express
the rapidity of life, the perpetual waste and repair; all so casual, all so haphazard.…
But after life. The slow pulling down of thick green stalks so that the cup of the flower, as it
turns over, deluges one with purple and red light. Why, after all, should one not be born there
as one is born here, helpless, speechless, unable to focus one’s eyesight, groping at the roots of
the grass, at the toes of the Giants? As for saying which are trees, and which are men and
women, or whether there are such things, that one won’t be in a condition to do for fifty years
or so. There will be nothing but spaces of light and dark, intersected by thick stalks, and rather
higher up perhaps, rose-shaped blots of an indistinct colour—dim pinks and blues—which will,
as time goes on, become more definite, become—I don’t know what.…
And yet that mark on the wall is not a hole at all. It may even be caused by some round black
substance, such as a small rose leaf, left over from the summer, and I, not being a very vigilant
housekeeper—look at the dust on the mantelpiece, for example, the dust which, so they say,
buried Troy three times over, only fragments of pots utterly refusing annihilation, as one can
believe.
The tree outside the window taps very gently on the pane.… I want to think quietly, calmly,
spaciously, never to be interrupted, never to have to rise from my chair, to slip easily from one
thing to another, without any sense of hostility, or obstacle. I want to sink deeper and deeper,
away from the surface, with its hard separate facts. To steady myself, let me catch hold of the
first idea that passes.… Shakespeare.… Well, he will do as well as another. A man who sat
himself solidly in an arm-chair, and looked into the fire, so— A shower of ideas fell perpetually
from some very high Heaven down through his mind. He leant his forehead on his hand, and
people, looking in through the open door,—for this scene is supposed to take place on a
summer’s evening—But how dull this is, this historical fiction! It doesn’t interest me at all. I
wish I could hit upon a pleasant track of thought, a track indirectly reflecting credit upon
myself, for those are the pleasantest thoughts, and very frequent even in the minds of modest
mouse-coloured people, who believe genuinely that they dislike to hear their own praises. They
are not thoughts directly praising oneself; that is the beauty of them; they are thoughts like
this:
“And then I came into the room. They were discussing botany. I said how I’d seen a flower
growing on a dust heap on the site of an old house in Kingsway. The seed, I said, must have
been sown in the reign of Charles the First. What flowers grew in the reign of Charles the First?”
I asked—(but, I don’t remember the answer). Tall flowers with purple tassels to them perhaps.
And so it goes on. All the time I’m dressing up the figure of myself in my own mind, lovingly,
stealthily, not openly adoring it, for if I did that, I should catch myself out, and stretch my hand
at once for a book in self-protection. Indeed, it is curious how instinctively one protects the
image of oneself from idolatry or any other handling that could make it ridiculous, or too unlike
the original to be believed in any longer. Or is it not so very curious after all? It is a matter of
great importance. Suppose the looking glass smashes, the image disappears, and the romantic
figure with the green of forest depths all about it is there no longer, but only that shell of a

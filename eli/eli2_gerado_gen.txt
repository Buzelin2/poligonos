As she walked away with her flowers, she noticed a man standing on the
corner, watching her with a knowing look in his eye. He was a tall,
dark-haired man with a moustache, and he seemed to be waiting for her.
Mrs Murcheson felt a shiver run down her spine as he stepped forward and
called out her name. ‘Mrs Murcheson!’ he said, his voice deep and
commanding. ‘I’ve been looking for you everywhere. My name is Mr Smith, and
I have a message for you from your husband. He’s been called away on
business, and he needs you to come to him at once. Can you come now?’

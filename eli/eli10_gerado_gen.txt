AT THE CORNER by the fire-station, where Southampton Row is joined by
Theobald’s Road, a little man, hurrying back to his office after the lunch
hour, was run over by a motor-lorry. He had been stepping backward to
avoid a taxi when worse befell him. What was left of him was taken to
hospital and remained for some days unidentified, as no papers of any sort
were to be found in his pockets.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

Meanwhile, in a small room over a shop in the same street, a woman sat
at a table, staring blankly at a piece of paper. She was the victim’s wife,
and she had been waiting for him to come home for lunch. When he failed
to appear, she had gone out to look for him, and had found him lying
in the street. She was in a state of distress, and the shopkeeper, who
knew her well, had sent for a doctor to come and see her. As she sat there,
she suddenly remembered that her husband always carried a small
leather case in his pocket, containing some papers of importance. She
got up and went to the window, and as she stood there, she saw a
policeman walking up and down the street, looking at the ground. She
called to him, and he came to the door. She told him about the leather
case, and he promised to look for it.

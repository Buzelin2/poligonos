‘She had such a lovely smile,’ said Mary Bridger, reflectively. They were
talking, the Bridgers and the Bagots, late one night over the fire about old
friends. This one, Helen Folliott, the girl with the lovely smile, had
vanished. None of them knew what had happened to her. She had come to
grief somehow, they had heard, and, they agreed, each of them had always
known that she would, and, what was odd, none of them had ever forgotten
her.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

The night was dark, and the fire crackled as the two women sat in the
comfort of their sitting room. They had known Helen since they were girls,
and the memory of her was still vivid in their minds. Her smile, which
Mary had mentioned, was the first thing that came to mind when they
thought of her. It was a smile that could light up a room, and yet, it was
a smile that seemed to hide something deeper, something that only
Helen knew. They wondered what had happened to her, and whether she
was still alive, somewhere, smiling as she went about her day. The
mystery of Helen's disappearance was one that they would never forget, and
one that they would always ponder, as they sat by the fire, lost in
their memories of her.

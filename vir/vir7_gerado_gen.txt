As I leaned on the balustrade, a warm breeze rustled the leaves of the
trees, and the sound of distant music floated up from the town below.
It was a waltz, and the melody was familiar, but I couldnâ€™t quite place
it. I closed my eyes and let the music wash over me, feeling the
gentle sway of the trees and the balustrade beneath my hand. It was a
magical moment, and I was grateful for the chance to escape the
formality of the dinner party and enjoy the peace and beauty of the
night.

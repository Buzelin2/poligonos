They came to the end of the wharf, where the boats lay, and the sound of the sea
mingled with the creaking of the cranes, and the snorting of the cattle trucks.
Fenella took her fatherâ€™s arm, and they stood looking out at the water, where
the Picton boat was just visible, its lights twinkling like the stars above. The
water was black as ink, and the sky was black as the heart of a dark flower.
The wind blew softly, and the sound of the sea was like a low, continuous
moan, as if it were mourning the dead of the war.

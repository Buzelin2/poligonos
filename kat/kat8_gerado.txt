As the cab lurched along, Leila found herself lost in a world of fantasy. She imagined she was at a ball, dancing with a tall, dark-haired man in a top hat and tailcoat. The music swirled around them, a lilting waltz that seemed to carry them higher and higher on a tide of laughter and joy. She felt his hand on her shoulder, guiding her through the steps with a gentle pressure, and she knew that she was completely his, lost in the magic of the moment.

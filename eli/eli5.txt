MAJENDIE HAD BOUGHT the villa on his honeymoon, and in April, three
months after his death, his widow went out there alone to spend the spring
and early summer. Stuart, who had been in India at the time of Howard
Majendie’s death, wrote to Mrs Majendie before starting for home and her
reply awaited him at his club; he re-read it several times, looking curiously
at her writing, which he had never seen before. The name of the villa was
familiar to him, Majendie had been speaking of it the last time they dined
together; he said it had a garden full of lemon trees and big cypresses, and
more fountains than you could imagine – it was these that Ellaline had
loved. Stuart pictured Mrs Majendie walking about among the lemon trees
in her widow’s black.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Elizabeth Bowen:

The ladybird, once settled, began to twitch its delicate antennae, as if in
appreciation of the warmth and security of its new perch. Marcia, watching
it, felt a sense of tranquillity steal over her, as if the presence of this tiny
creature had brought her a sense of peace. The sun, now dipping low in the
sky, cast a golden glow over the garden, and the air was filled with the
sweet scent of blooming flowers. It was a moment of pure contentment, and
Marcia felt grateful for the simple joys that life had to offer.

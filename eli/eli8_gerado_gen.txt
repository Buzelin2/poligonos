Herbert stepped into the drawing-room, where the blinds were still
down, and the room was in darkness. The air was heavy with the scent of
fresh flowers, and the sound of a piano was audible through the closed
door of the morning-room. Cicely, seated at the instrument, played a
bright, lively waltz, which seemed to fill the room with a lively,
cheerful atmosphere. Her back was turned to the door, and she did not
notice Herbert's entrance.

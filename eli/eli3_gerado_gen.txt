MR AND MRS TOTTENHAM had come home.
The moist brown gravel of the drive and sweep bore impress of their fly
wheels. Lydia Broadbent listened from the doorstep to the receding gritty
rumble of the empty fly, and the click and rattle as the gate swung to.
Behind her, in the dusky hall, Mr Tottenham shouted directions for the
disposal of the luggage, flustered servants bumped against each other and
recoiled, and Porloch the gardener shouldered the heavy trunks with gasps
and lurches, clutching at the banisters until they creaked.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

Upstairs, in the bedrooms, the Tottenhams' dressing-gowns hung on hooks,
their slippers stood in a row on the mat, and their toilet-bags were
settled in their proper places. Lydia Broadbent's eyes wandered through the
rooms, taking in the familiar landmarks of the Tottenhams' life. The
portraits of their ancestors on the walls, the silver-backed brushes on the
toilet-tables, the books on the shelves, the photographs on the mantelpiece.
Everything was as it should be, yet everything was different. The Tottenhams
were home, but they were not quite themselves.

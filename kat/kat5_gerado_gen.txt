In her blue dress, with her cheeks lightly flushed, her blue, blue eyes, and
her gold curls pinned up as though for the first time — pinned up to be out
of the way for her flight — Mrs. Raddick’s daughter might have just
dropped from this radiant heaven. Mrs. Raddick’s timid, faintly astonished,
but deeply admiring glance looked as if she believed it, too; but the
daughter didn’t appear any too pleased — why should she? — to have
alighted on the steps of the Casino. Indeed, she was bored — bored as
though Heaven had been full of casinos with snuffy old saints for croupiers
and crowns to play with.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

The daughter glanced at her watch and then at her mother, and Mrs. Raddick
knew that she was waiting for something. She herself was waiting, too,
for the daughter to speak, to tell her what it was that she had to say. But
the daughter said nothing, and Mrs. Raddick realized that she would have
to make the first move. "Shall we go in, dear?" she asked, her voice
tentative and polite, as though she were asking the daughter to accompany
her to a funeral. The daughter hesitated, then nodded curtly, and Mrs.
Raddick led the way into the Casino. As they entered, the daughter’s
eyes swept the room with a rapid, impersonal glance, and Mrs. Raddick knew
that she was searching for something. What it was, she couldn’t tell, but
she knew that her daughter was not interested in the other people in the
room, or in the gambling, or in the music. She was searching for
something else, something that she had lost, or never had, and was now
determined to find.

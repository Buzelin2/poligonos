... “You must be very careful, my dear. You see, this is a foreign land,
and people here are not like those at home. They may seem friendly, but
they are not to be trusted. You must keep a close eye on your valuables and
don’t let anyone touch them without your permission. And when you arrive
at the hotel, be sure to check the room before you unpack. You don’t want
any unwanted visitors snooping around your belongings. And if you have to
use a taxi, make sure it’s a reputable one and the driver is trustworthy. I
know it’s a lot to take in, but you must be vigilant, my dear. Your safety is
of the utmost importance.”

The Governess listened intently to the lady’s words, her mind racing with
all the new information and advice. She knew that she would have to be
careful, but she also felt a sense of excitement and adventure at the
thought of exploring a new country and culture. As the train pulled out of
the station, she settled back into her seat and began to make a mental
list of all the things she needed to do and see during her time in Munich.

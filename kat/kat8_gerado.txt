Exactly when the ball began Leila would have found it hard to say. Perhaps
her first real partner was the cab. It did not matter that she shared the cab
with the Sheridan girls and their brother. She sat back in her own little
corner of it, and the bolster on which her hand rested felt like the sleeve of
an unknown young manâ€™s dress suit; and away they bowled, past waltzing
lamp-posts and houses and fences and trees.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Katherine Mansfield:

As the cab lurched along, Leila found herself lost in a world of fantasy. She imagined she was at a ball, dancing with a tall, dark-haired man in a top hat and tailcoat. The music swirled around them, a lilting waltz that seemed to carry them higher and higher on a tide of laughter and joy. She felt his hand on her shoulder, guiding her through the steps with a gentle pressure, and she knew that she was completely his, lost in the magic of the moment.

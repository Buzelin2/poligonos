Mrs Sutton's voice, a gentle hum of bees, flowed on, a tide of words,
carrying with it the scent of roses, the rustle of leaves, the gossamer
flicker of butterflies' wings. Stuart Elton listened, lost in the
limpid depths of her eyes, as if he had fallen into a pool of dark
water, and the world had receded from him, leaving him afloat,
unanchored, yet at peace. The words she spoke, a gentle breeze
stirring the surface of his mind, ruffled his thoughts, and he felt
himself drifting, carried along on the current of her voice, as if he
were a leaf on a river, carried to places unknown, yet welcomed,
yet cherished.

HE WAS A pale little man, with big teeth and prominent eyes; sitting opposite
to him in a bus one would have found it incredible that there could be a
woman to love him. As a matter of fact there were two, one dead, not
counting a mother whose inarticulate devotion he resented, and a pale sister,
also dead.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Elizabeth Bowen:

The sister, who had been his sole companion in his lonely house, was now
departed also, and the little man found himself alone with his thoughts,
which were not of the most pleasant nature. He had always been a man of
little ambition, and his life had been one of quiet desperation, but now he
found himself plunged into a sea of despair, from which he saw no escape.
As he sat in the bus, staring blankly ahead, he felt as though he were
being swept away by a tide of melancholy, and he could not shake off the
feeling that his life was drawing to a close.

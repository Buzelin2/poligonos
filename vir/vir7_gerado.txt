The mansion of the eighteenth century Earl had been changed in the
twentieth century into a Club. And it was pleasant, after dining in the great
room with the pillars and the chandeliers under a glare of light to go out on
to the balcony overlooking the Park. The trees were in full leaf, and had
there been a moon, one could have seen the pink and cream coloured
cockades on the chestnut trees. But it was a moonless night; very warm,
after a fine summerâ€™s day.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

As I stood on the balcony, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disorientation. The
mansion, once the grandest in the land, was now a place of quiet, refined
indolence. The air was heavy with the scent of blooming flowers, and the
sound of crickets provided a soothing background hum. It was as if time had
stood still, and the world outside had moved on without this place. I
wondered what secrets lay hidden behind the walls, what stories remained
unspoken. The night was still young, and I had a feeling that anything
might happen.

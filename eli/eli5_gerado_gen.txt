The sound of the sea was incessant, and the air was filled with the scent
of orange blossom and the hum of bees. Mrs Majendie sat on a bench
under a lemon tree, her face turned to the sun, and her hands clasped
together in her lap. She was thinking of her husband, and how he had
spoken of this place with such love and longing, and how she had never
understood why. Now she knew. The villa was a place of peace, a place
where one could escape from the world and its demands, and simply be.
Mrs Majendie felt a sense of peace wash over her, and she closed her
eyes, letting the warmth of the sun soak into her skin. She was grateful
for this place, for the memories it held, and for the chance to be alone
with her thoughts. As she sat there, she knew that she would return to
this place again and again, to remember and to heal.

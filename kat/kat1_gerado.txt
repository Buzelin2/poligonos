SUDDENLY — dreadfully — she wakes up. What has happened?
Something dreadful has happened. No — nothing has happened. It is only
the wind shaking the house, rattling the windows, banging a piece of iron
on the roof and making her bed tremble. Leaves flutter past the window, up
and away; down in the avenue a whole newspaper wags in the air like a lost
kite and falls, spiked on a pine tree. It is cold. Summer is over — it is
autumn — everything is ugly. The carts rattle by, swinging from side to
side; two Chinamen lollop along under their wooden yokes with the
straining vegetable baskets — their pigtails and blue blouses fly out in the
wind. A white dog on three legs yelps past the gate. It is all over! What is?
Oh, everything! And she begins to plait her hair with shaking fingers, not
daring to look in the glass. Mother is talking to grandmother in the hall.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Katherine Mansfield:

The rain patters on the windowpane, a steady, monotonous beat, like the
ticking of a clock. It is a melancholy sound, and it seems to match the
mood of the house, which is heavy and somber, as if it too were
mourning the loss of summer. The air is cool and damp, and the
chilliness seeps into every corner of the room, making her shiver. She
tries to pull the blanket tighter around her, but it is no use. The cold
seems to have seeped into her very bones, and she can't shake off the
feeling of sadness that has settled over her like a shroud. Outside, the
leaves are rustling in the wind, like a chorus of mournful voices, and
their rustling seems to echo her own sadness, as if they too are
mourning the passing of the summer.

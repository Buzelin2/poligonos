The rain patters on the windowpane, a steady, monotonous beat, like the
ticking of a clock. It is a melancholy sound, and it seems to match the
mood of the house, which is heavy and somber, as if it too were
mourning the loss of summer. The air is cool and damp, and the
chilliness seeps into every corner of the room, making her shiver. She
tries to pull the blanket tighter around her, but it is no use. The cold
seems to have seeped into her very bones, and she can't shake off the
feeling of sadness that has settled over her like a shroud. Outside, the
leaves are rustling in the wind, like a chorus of mournful voices, and
their rustling seems to echo her own sadness, as if they too are
mourning the passing of the summer.

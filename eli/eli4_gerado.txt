Mauriceâ€™s voice had been sharp, like the snapping of a twig, and his eyes
had narrowed into a scowl that seemed to darken the air around her.
Penelope felt a sudden chill, as if a cloud had passed across the sun,
and she shivered, huddling deeper into her coat. The wind had risen,
and the branches of the trees outside the window whipped and creaked
like the skeletons of dead giants. The room seemed to shrink and
constrict, as if it were being squeezed in on itself by some unseen hand.

‘YOU ARE LOSING your imagination,’ cried Maurice.
It was a bitter reproach. He stood over her, rumpling up his hair, and the
wiry tufts sprang upright, quivering from his scalp.
Penelope gulped, then sat for a moment in a silence full of the
consciousness of her brutality. She had never dreamed that her secret
preoccupation would be so perceptible to Maurice. Unconsciously she had
been drawing her imaginations in upon herself like the petals of a flower,
and her emotions buzzed and throbbed within them like a pent-up bee.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Elizabeth Bowen:

Maurice’s voice had been sharp, like the snapping of a twig, and his eyes
had narrowed into a scowl that seemed to darken the air around her.
Penelope felt a sudden chill, as if a cloud had passed across the sun,
and she shivered, huddling deeper into her coat. The wind had risen,
and the branches of the trees outside the window whipped and creaked
like the skeletons of dead giants. The room seemed to shrink and
constrict, as if it were being squeezed in on itself by some unseen hand.

Your turn! Please continue the story in the style of Elizabeth Bowen, using the paragraph you just wrote as a starting point.

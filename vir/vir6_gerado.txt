They were married. The wedding march pealed out. The pigeons fluttered.
Small boys in Eton jackets threw rice; a fox terrier sauntered across the
path; and Ernest Thorburn led his bride to the car through that small
inquisitive crowd of complete strangers which always collects in London to
enjoy other peopleâ€™s happiness or unhappiness. Certainly he looked
handsome and she looked shy. More rice was thrown, and the car moved
off.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

As they drove away from the church, the bride leaned back against the
cushions of the car, feeling a sense of disbelief at the sudden change in
her life. She had always known that she would marry Ernest, of course,
but the actuality of it was almost too much to take in. She felt as if she
were floating on a cloud, detached from the world around her, and yet
aware of every detail of the scene outside the car window. The
churchyard, with its ancient yew trees and crumbling headstones,
seemed to stretch out before her like a landscape of memories, each one
more vivid than the last. And yet, as the car moved forward, she knew
that she was leaving all that behind, entering a new world of
responsibilities and obligations, of which she had only the faintest
glimmer of understanding.

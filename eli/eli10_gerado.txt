AT THE CORNER by the fire-station, where Southampton Row is joined by
Theobald’s Road, a little man, hurrying back to his office after the lunch
hour, was run over by a motor-lorry. He had been stepping backward to
avoid a taxi when worse befell him. What was left of him was taken to
hospital and remained for some days unidentified, as no papers of any sort
were to be found in his pockets.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Elizabeth Bowen:

The police, after inquiries, were able to trace the man’s identity by
means of a photograph in a newspaper. He was a clerk in a small
firm of solicitors in Chancery Lane, and his name was Charles
Roland. His family was informed, and they came to the hospital to
identify the remains. They were shocked and grieved beyond
expression, and they asked the police to make inquiries as to how
the accident had occurred. The driver of the lorry was interviewed,
and he said that he had been driving slowly and carefully, and that he
had not seen the man stepping backward. He was a foreigner, and he
spoke little English. The police were unable to learn any further
information, and the case remained a mystery.

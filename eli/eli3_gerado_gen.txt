Upstairs, in the bedrooms, the Tottenhams' dressing-gowns hung on hooks,
their slippers stood in a row on the mat, and their toilet-bags were
settled in their proper places. Lydia Broadbent's eyes wandered through the
rooms, taking in the familiar landmarks of the Tottenhams' life. The
portraits of their ancestors on the walls, the silver-backed brushes on the
toilet-tables, the books on the shelves, the photographs on the mantelpiece.
Everything was as it should be, yet everything was different. The Tottenhams
were home, but they were not quite themselves.

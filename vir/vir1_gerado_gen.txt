Mrs Sutton was talking about her son, who was in the army, and how she
wondered what he was doing at that very moment, and how she longed to see
him again. Stuart Elton listened with a pang in his heart, remembering
when his own son had been in the army, and how he too had wondered and
longed. And as he listened he felt the petals falling, falling, falling, until he
was all petals, all glow, all warmth, and he knew that he was not alone in
the world, that there were others like him, others who had known and felt
the same things. And he knew that he would always be there, stooping and
flicking off threads, listening to Mrs Sutton's stories, and feeling the
avalanche of sensation that came with each new petal that fell.

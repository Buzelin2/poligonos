There was a little dent on the top of the mountain like a crater on the moon.
It was filled with snow, iridescent like a pigeonâ€™s breast, or dead white.
There was a scurry of dry particles now and again, covering nothing. It was
too high for breathing flesh or fur covered life. All the same the snow was
iridescent one moment; and blood red; and pure white, according to the day.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

The mountain was a lonely place, untouched by the passing of time. The snow
that fell upon it was the only witness to the seasons, and it too, was unchanging.
The wind that howled through the valleys below, was the only one to disturb
the silence of the mountain top. It whispered tales of far-off lands, and the
secrets of the universe, to the snow that lay there, unmoved. And so, the
mountain stood, a sentinel of solitude, a sentinel of the unchanging.

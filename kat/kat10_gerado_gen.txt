The little crowd on the wharf watched with a mixture of awe and unease as the ship slowly began to move. The engines roared to life, and the massive vessel slid away from the dock with a gentle push of the water. The gulls continued to scream and dive, their cries echoing across the water as the ship picked up speed. The little flies on the deck scurried about, seemingly unaware of the drama unfolding before them. As the ship moved further and further away from the wharf, the little crowd watched in wonder, their eyes fixed on the massive vessel as it disappeared into the distance.

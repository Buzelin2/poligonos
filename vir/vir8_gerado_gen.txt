‘She had such a lovely smile,’ said Mary Bridger, reflectively. They were
talking, the Bridgers and the Bagots, late one night over the fire about old
friends. This one, Helen Folliott, the girl with the lovely smile, had
vanished. None of them knew what had happened to her. She had come to
grief somehow, they had heard, and, they agreed, each of them had always
known that she would, and, what was odd, none of them had ever forgotten
her.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

It was a strange and disquieting thing, the way that Helen Folliott had
faded out of their lives. She had been a part of their group, one of the
little circle of friends who had known each other since school, and yet,
now, she was gone, and they had no idea where or how. They had tried to
track her down, of course, but no one seemed to know anything. It was
almost as if she had never existed at all. And yet, they knew that she had,
and they knew that she was gone, and that was the most disquieting thing of
all. They had all been so young when they had known her, so full of hope
and dreams, and now, here they were, grown old and grey, and Helen was
gone, and they would never see her again. They had always known that she
wouldn’t last, but they had never expected this. It was a hard thing to
accept, and they knew that they never would.

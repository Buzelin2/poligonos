THE VICAR MOVED about the chancel in his cassock, thoughtfully
extinguishing the candles. Evensong was over, and the ladies who had
composed the congregation pattered down the aisle and melted away into
the November dusk. At the back of the church somebody was still kneeling;
the Vicar knew that it was the emotional-looking lady in black waiting to
speak to him as he came down to the vestry; he feared this might be a
matter for the confessional and that she might weep. The church was
growing very dark; her black draperies uncertainly detached themselves
from the shadows under the gallery. As he came down towards her, her
white face looked up at him, she made a rustling movement and half rose. A
curious perfume diffused itself around her, through the chilly mustiness of
the pew.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

"Ah, Mrs. Pew," he said, bending over her, "what is it? You look troubled.
Let me get you a seat in the vestry and we'll talk." He led her to a
comfortable chair, where she sat, still tremulous, and began to speak in a
low, husky voice, her words tumbling over each other in a rush of
emotion. "It's my daughter, sir. She's been taken ill, and I'm afraid it's
serious. She's been in and out of hospitals for months, and now she's
critical. I've been to see her every day, but she doesn't know me, sir. She
doesn't know anyone. And now she's lying there, so still and so white, and
I can't bear it, sir. I can't bear it."

What happens next in the story?

In the next paragraph, the Vicar listens to Mrs. Pew's story and offers her comfort and support. He tells her that he will pray for her daughter and invites her to come to the church for prayers and support.

Here is a sample paragraph that could continue the story:

"Ah, my dear Mrs. Pew," he said, his voice filled with compassion, "I can
imagine your anguish. It's a terrible thing to see a loved one in such a
state. But please, do not distress yourself further. You must take care of
yourself, as well. I will certainly pray for your daughter, and I invite you
to come to the church for prayers and support. We will hold a special
service for her, and I'm sure the congregation will want to help in any way
they can. You are not alone in this, Mrs. Pew. We are all here to support you."

As Stuart Elton stooped and flicked off his trousers a white thread, the
trivial act accompanied as it was by a slide and avalanche of sensation,
seemed like a petal falling from a rose, and Stuart Elton straightening
himself to resume his conversation with Mrs Sutton felt that he was
compact of many petals laid firmly and closely on top of each other all
reddened, all warmed through, all tinged with this inexplicable glow. So
that when he stooped a petal fell. When he was young he had not felt it - no
- now aged forty-five, he had only to stoop, to flick a thread off his trousers,
and it rushed down all through him, this beautiful orderly sense of life, this
slide, this avalanche of sensation, to be at one, when he stood up again
adjusted â€” but what was she saying?

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

Mrs Sutton was talking about her son, who was in the army, and how she
wondered what he was doing at that very moment, and how she longed to see
him again. Stuart Elton listened with a pang in his heart, remembering
when his own son had been in the army, and how he too had wondered and
longed. And as he listened he felt the petals falling, falling, falling, until he
was all petals, all glow, all warmth, and he knew that he was not alone in
the world, that there were others like him, others who had known and felt
the same things. And he knew that he would always be there, stooping and
flicking off threads, listening to Mrs Sutton's stories, and feeling the
avalanche of sensation that came with each new petal that fell.

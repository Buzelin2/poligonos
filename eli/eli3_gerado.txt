MR AND MRS TOTTENHAM had come home.
The moist brown gravel of the drive and sweep bore impress of their fly
wheels. Lydia Broadbent listened from the doorstep to the receding gritty
rumble of the empty fly, and the click and rattle as the gate swung to.
Behind her, in the dusky hall, Mr Tottenham shouted directions for the
disposal of the luggage, flustered servants bumped against each other and
recoiled, and Porloch the gardener shouldered the heavy trunks with gasps
and lurches, clutching at the banisters until they creaked.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Elizabeth Bowen:

Lydia Broadbent's eyes narrowed as she watched the departing fly, her
hands clasped behind her back, her lips pursed in a thoughtful frown.
She had always found the Tottenhams a curious couple, their manner of
speech, their dress, their very way of moving, all so different from the
rest of the county. And yet, she had always felt a certain affinity for
them, as if they were kindred spirits, lost in a world that did not quite
understand them. As she stood there, she wondered what secrets they had
brought back with them from their travels, and what new stories they
would tell in the quiet hours of the night.

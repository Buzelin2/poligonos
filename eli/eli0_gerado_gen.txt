COMING INTO MOHER over the bridge, you may see a terrace of houses by the
river. They are to the left of the bridge, below it. Their narrow height and
faded air of importance make them seem to mark the approach to some
larger town. The six dwellings unite into one frontage, colour-washed
apricot years ago. They face north. Their lower sash windows, front steps
and fanlit front doors are screened by lime trees, making for privacy. There
are area railings. Between them and the water runs a road with a parapet,
which comes to its end opposite the last house.


write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

As you approach the houses, you notice a faint smell of dampness
emanating from the walls, and the sound of dripping water echoes
through the stillness of the terrace. Despite this, the houses seem to
exude a sense of history and tradition, as if they have been witness to
countless events over the years. The faded grandeur of the terrace is
evident in the intricate moldings and carvings that adorn the front doors,
and the peeling paint on the walls seems to hold secrets of a bygone era.
As you step closer, you can see that the windows are adorned with
curtains, though they are thin and tattered, and the once-elegant fanlights
are now cracked and faded. Despite the neglect, there is a sense of
solitude and quietness that pervades the terrace, as if it is a place where
time has stood still for many years.

Mrs. Raddick, with her plump, rosy hands, and her gentle, humble smile,
might have been the very embodiment of the goodness and purity that the
Casino was supposed to represent. But, oh, the sadness in her eyes!
Sadness that seemed to say, “I, too, have known the joy of flight,
but alas, my wings have been clipped.” And the daughter, with her
careless, lounging attitude, her eyes fixed on some distant point, her
thoughts far away, seemed to be saying, “I, too, have known the thrill of
the unknown, but now I am grounded, and all my dreams are but a
memory.” And so, the two of them, mother and daughter, stood there,
in that grand, gilded hall, with its glittering chandeliers and its
resplendent decor, like two birds, caught in a trap, longing to fly
again, but unable to.

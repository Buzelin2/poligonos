MISS MURCHESON STOPPED AT the corner of the High Street to buy a bunch of
daffodils from the flower-man. She counted out her money very carefully,
pouring a little stream of coppers from her purse into the palm of her hand.
‘— ninepence – ten – eleven – pence halfpenny – a shilling! Thank you
very much. Good afternoon.’

As she walked away with her flowers, she noticed a man standing on the
corner, watching her with a knowing look in his eye. He was a tall,
dark-haired man with a moustache, and he seemed to be waiting for her.
Mrs Murcheson felt a shiver run down her spine as he stepped forward and
called out her name. ‘Mrs Murcheson!’ he said, his voice deep and
commanding. ‘I’ve been looking for you everywhere. My name is Mr Smith, and
I have a message for you from your husband. He’s been called away on
business, and he needs you to come to him at once. Can you come now?’

MISS MURCHESON WAS ALARMED. She had not heard from her husband in weeks,
and she had been worried sick about him. She had no idea where he was or what
he was doing, and now this stranger was telling her that he needed her to
come to him at once. She hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to do.
But then she remembered the way he had looked at her, the way he had
known her name and her husband’s message. She felt a strange sense of
trust in him, and she knew that she had to go with him.

‘Of course I’ll come with you,’ she said, trying to keep her voice steady.
‘Where is he?’ ‘He’s in a place called Blackwater,’ Mr Smith replied,
nodding towards the east. ‘It’s a long way from here, but we’ll get there soon
enough. You just have to trust me, Mrs Murcheson. Your husband needs you,
and I’m the only one who can take you to him.’

How does this continue the story?

MISS MURCHESON FOLLOWED MR SMITH OUT OF THE TOWN, HER HEART RACING WITH
WONDER AND FEAR. SHE HAD NEVER BEEN THIS WAY BEFORE, AND SHE DID NOT
KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. BUT SHE KNEW THAT SHE HAD TO GO WITH MR SMITH,
NO MATTER HOW DANGEROUS IT MAY BE. AS THEY WALKED, MR SMITH TOLD HER
STORIES ABOUT HER HUSBAND, HOW HE WAS A BRAVE AND HONORABLE MAN WHO
HAD BEEN CALLED TO DO IMPORTANT WORK. MISS MURCHESON LISTENED, HER
MIND FILLED WITH QUESTIONS AND DOUBTS. BUT SHE KNEW THAT SHE HAD TO
TRUST MR SMITH, FOR HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD TAKE HER TO HER
HUSBAND.

The sun beat down on the parade, making the shells glisten, and the old men
strolled along, their canes tapping out a slow, measured rhythm. They
seemed to be in no hurry, as if they had all the time in the world to
stroll, to chat, to watch the world go by. And indeed, it was as if they
were all part of some great, slow-moving machine, a machine that ground
along steadily, without a care in the world. The women, too, seemed to
be part of this machine, their footsteps echoing the rhythm of the men's
canes, their eyes fixed on some distant point, their faces serene. It was
as if they were all caught up in some great, unending dream, a dream of
seaside towns and shells and slow, measured strolls. And yet, beneath
this dreamy surface, there was a sense of unease, a feeling that
something was not quite right, that the world was not quite as it
seemed. The wind off the sea carried whispers of a deeper reality, a
reality that lay just beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered.

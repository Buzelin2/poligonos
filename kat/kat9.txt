Like all seaside towns it was pervaded by the smell of fish. The toy shops
were full of shells, varnished, hard yet fragile. Even the inhabitants had a
shelly look - a frivolous look as if the real animal had been extracted on the
point of a pin and only the shell remained. The old men on the parade were
shells. Their gaiters, their riding breeches, their spy glasses seemed to make
them into toys. They could no more have been real sailors or real sportsmen
than the shells stuck onto the rims of photograph frames and looking-
glasses could have lain in the depths of the sea. The women too, with their
trousers and their little high heeled shoes and their raffia bags and their
pearl necklaces seemed shells of real women who go out in the morning to
buy household stores.

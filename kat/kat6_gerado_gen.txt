They came to the end of the Old Wharf and turned into a narrow passage
between two high wooden walls, and here the darkness was so complete
that they had to feel their way along, their hands outstretched, as if they
were blind. The passage opened into a small, dimly lit yard, and here they
found the Picton boat, a black shape against the darkness of the water.
Fenella hesitated, feeling for the boatâ€™s rail with her foot, and then
stepped aboard, her heart beating fast with excitement and a little fear.

It seemed to the little crowd on the wharf that she was never going to move
again. There she lay, immense, motionless on the grey crinkled water, a
loop of smoke above her, an immense flock of gulls screaming and diving
after the galley droppings at the stern. You could just see little couples
parading — little flies walking up and down the dish on the grey crinkled
tablecloth. Other flies clustered and swarmed at the edge. Now there was a
gleam of white on the lower deck — the cook’s apron or the stewardess
perhaps. Now a tiny black spider raced up the ladder on to the bridge.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Katherine Mansfield:

The sun beat down on the ship, making the paint shine like wet silk, and the
creaking and groaning of the timbers sounded like the complaints of a tired
old woman. The captain stood at the railing, his hands shaded by the brim
of his hat, watching the shore grow smaller and smaller as the ship moved
on. He was a tall, thin man with a long white beard and a weathered face
that had seen many storms. His eyes were deep-set and far away, as if he
were looking at some distant land. The mate stood beside him, his eyes
scanning the horizon for any sign of danger. He was a short, stout man
with a red face and a loud voice, and he kept shouting orders to the crew
as they worked to get the ship under way.

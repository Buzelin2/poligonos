In her blue dress, with her cheeks lightly flushed, her blue, blue eyes, and
her gold curls pinned up as though for the first time — pinned up to be out
of the way for her flight — Mrs. Raddick’s daughter might have just
dropped from this radiant heaven. Mrs. Raddick’s timid, faintly astonished,
but deeply admiring glance looked as if she believed it, too; but the
daughter didn’t appear any too pleased — why should she? — to have
alighted on the steps of the Casino. Indeed, she was bored — bored as
though Heaven had been full of casinos with snuffy old saints for croupiers
and crowns to play with.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Katherine Mansfield:

Mrs. Raddick, with her plump, rosy hands, and her gentle, humble smile,
might have been the very embodiment of the goodness and purity that the
Casino was supposed to represent. But, oh, the sadness in her eyes!
Sadness that seemed to say, “I, too, have known the joy of flight,
but alas, my wings have been clipped.” And the daughter, with her
careless, lounging attitude, her eyes fixed on some distant point, her
thoughts far away, seemed to be saying, “I, too, have known the thrill of
the unknown, but now I am grounded, and all my dreams are but a
memory.” And so, the two of them, mother and daughter, stood there,
in that grand, gilded hall, with its glittering chandeliers and its
resplendent decor, like two birds, caught in a trap, longing to fly
again, but unable to.

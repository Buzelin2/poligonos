As I stood on the balcony, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disorientation. The
mansion, once the grandest in the land, was now a place of quiet, refined
indolence. The air was heavy with the scent of blooming flowers, and the
sound of crickets provided a soothing background hum. It was as if time had
stood still, and the world outside had moved on without this place. I
wondered what secrets lay hidden behind the walls, what stories remained
unspoken. The night was still young, and I had a feeling that anything
might happen.

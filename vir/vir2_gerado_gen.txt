Their footsteps echoed through the empty rooms, their whispers growing
fainter as they moved further away. They reached the top floor, where a
dozen doors opened onto a balcony that overlooked the garden. They
peered out, their eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of life. And
then, they saw it â€“ a faint light flickering in the distance. They
exchanged a knowing look, and with a soft rustle of fabric, they
disappeared into the night, leaving behind the silent, empty house.

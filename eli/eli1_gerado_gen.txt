Mr. Rossiterâ€™s eyes wandered over the room, taking in the neatness and
order that his wife had maintained despite the arrival of the children. The
room itself was small and plain, with white walls and a white ceiling,
and a long table down the middle of it. The chairs were of the plainest
pattern, but they were all neatly covered with white covers, and the table
was laid with a clean white cloth. The windows were open, and a faint
breeze stirred the curtains, letting in a little light and a faint sound of
the garden beyond.

As he approached, his eyes were drawn to the figure of his wife, standing
at the stove, her back to him, her apron stained with the remains of
breakfast. She was a tall, dark woman, with a face that seemed to be
etched from the same mould as the house itself, and her movements were
as slow and deliberate as the passage of time itself. Even as he
watched, he could see the lines of weariness deepening around her eyes,
as though the very act of living were a burden too great for her to bear.
And yet, despite the exhaustion that seemed to cling to her like a
shadow, there was a quiet grace about her, a sense of unyielding
determination that brooked no opposition. It was as though she were a
sentinel standing watch over the household, a sentinel who would not
be swayed by the winds of fate, who would not be deterred by the
weight of the years.

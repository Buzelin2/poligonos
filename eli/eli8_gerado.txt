Herbert, with a smile of gratification, followed the maid into the
drawing-room, where Cicely, rising from her chair, greeted him with a
mixed expression of surprise and pleasure. She was looking particularly
well, he thought, and her dress, though not of the latest mode, was
neatly designed and well-suited to her slender figure. As she took his
coat and hat, he noticed that her hands were not quite as steady as they
used to be, and he felt a pang of regret for the way things had turned
out between them. Still, he consoled himself, she had done well for herself
in marrying Richard Evans, and he was glad to see her happy.

The mansion of the eighteenth century Earl had been changed in the
twentieth century into a Club. And it was pleasant, after dining in the great
room with the pillars and the chandeliers under a glare of light to go out on
to the balcony overlooking the Park. The trees were in full leaf, and had
there been a moon, one could have seen the pink and cream coloured
cockades on the chestnut trees. But it was a moonless night; very warm,
after a fine summer’s day.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

As I leaned on the balustrade, a warm breeze rustled the leaves of the
trees, and the sound of distant music floated up from the town below.
It was a waltz, and the melody was familiar, but I couldn’t quite place
it. I closed my eyes and let the music wash over me, feeling the
gentle sway of the trees and the balustrade beneath my hand. It was a
magical moment, and I was grateful for the chance to escape the
formality of the dinner party and enjoy the peace and beauty of the
night.

Although it was so brilliantly fine — the blue sky powdered with gold and
great spots of light like white wine splashed over the Jardins Publiques —
Miss Brill was glad that she had decided on her fur. The air was motionless,
but when you opened your mouth there was just a faint chill, like a chill
from a glass of iced water before you sip, and now and again a leaf came
drifting — from nowhere, from the sky. Miss Brill put up her hand and
touched her fur. Dear little thing! It was nice to feel it again. She had taken
it out of its box that afternoon, shaken out the moth-powder, given it a good
brush, and rubbed the life back into the dim little eyes. “What has been
happening to me?” said the sad little eyes. Oh, how sweet it was to see them
snap at her again from the red eiderdown!... But the nose, which was of
some black composition, wasn’t at all firm. It must have had a knock,
somehow. Never mind — a little dab of black sealing-wax when the time
came — when it was absolutely necessary... Little rogue! Yes, she really felt
like that about it. Little rogue biting its tail just by her left ear. She could
have taken it off and laid it on her lap and stroked it. She felt a tingling in
her hands and arms, but that came from walking, she supposed. And when
she breathed, something light and sad — no, not sad, exactly — something
gentle seemed to move in her bosom.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

As she walked, Miss Brill found herself thinking of her father, who had
died when she was a girl. He had always liked her to wear her fur when they
went out together, and she could remember his pleased look when she put it
on. “Looks nice, my dear,” he would say, and she would feel a warmth in
her heart, as if he were there now, smiling at her. She had kept the fur all
these years, even though it was a bit worn and faded, because it was his
favorite, and because it made her feel close to him. Now, as she walked
through the Jardins Publiques, she felt his presence with her, and the fur
seemed to hold him close, as if he were wrapped in its warmth and softness.

trivial act accompanied as it was by a slide and avalanche of sensation,
seemed like a petal falling from a rose, and Stuart Elton straightening

and it rushed down all through him, this beautiful orderly sense of life, this
slide, this avalanche of sensation, to be at one, when he stood up again
adjusted â€” but what was she saying?

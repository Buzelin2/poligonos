The police, after inquiries, were able to trace the manâ€™s identity by
means of a photograph in a newspaper. He was a clerk in a small
firm of solicitors in Chancery Lane, and his name was Charles
Roland. His family was informed, and they came to the hospital to
identify the remains. They were shocked and grieved beyond
expression, and they asked the police to make inquiries as to how
the accident had occurred. The driver of the lorry was interviewed,
and he said that he had been driving slowly and carefully, and that he
had not seen the man stepping backward. He was a foreigner, and he
spoke little English. The police were unable to learn any further
information, and the case remained a mystery.

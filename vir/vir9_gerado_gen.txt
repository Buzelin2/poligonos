The sea itself seemed to be a shell, a vast conch shell that had washed up
on the shore, its surface glinting and trembling in the sunlight. The
children playing on the beach were like the tiny barnacles that cling to
the shell, their laughter and shouts echoing across the water as they
chased each other and built sandcastles. Even the sky seemed to be a
shell, a great dome of blue that curved over the town and the sea,
protecting them from harm and keeping them safe within its embrace.
As the sun began to set, the shells of the town seemed to glow with a
soft, golden light, as if they had been filled with a radiance from within,
and the sea itself seemed to take on a deeper, more mysterious hue, as if
it were a vast, dark shell that held secrets and mysteries beyond the
understanding of mortal men.

The air was full of the scent of blossoming jasmine and the sound of birdsong, and as she walked through the garden, Mrs Majendie felt a sense of peace that she had not known for many months. It was as if the beauty of the villa and the memories it held had the power to heal her grief, to bring her back to the world of the living. She sat down on a bench beneath a tall cypress tree, and closed her eyes, letting the warmth of the sun on her face and the sound of the birdsong fill her heart with a sense of wonder and awe.

Like all seaside towns it was pervaded by the smell of fish. The toy shops
were full of shells, varnished, hard yet fragile. Even the inhabitants had a
shelly look - a frivolous look as if the real animal had been extracted on the
point of a pin and only the shell remained. The old men on the parade were
shells. Their gaiters, their riding breeches, their spy glasses seemed to make
them into toys. They could no more have been real sailors or real sportsmen
than the shells stuck onto the rims of photograph frames and looking-
glasses could have lain in the depths of the sea. The women too, with their
trousers and their little high heeled shoes and their raffia bags and their
pearl necklaces seemed shells of real women who go out in the morning to
buy household stores.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

The sun beat down on the parade, making the shells glimmer and shine, and the old men, like the shells, seemed to be basking in its warmth. They leaned on their canes, their eyes closed, their faces tilted upwards, as if they were drinking in the sunshine. The women, too, seemed to be basking in the sun, their faces flushed and their hair slightly disheveled. The whole scene was like a tableau, a painting of a seaside resort in the early 20th century, complete with its shell-like inhabitants and its sun-drenched parade. And yet, as one looked closer, one saw that there was something unsettling about this scene, something that didn't quite fit. The shells, for instance, seemed to be wearing the wrong faces, their smooth, unyielding surfaces a stark contrast to the soft, yielding flesh beneath. And the old men, with their riding breeches and their gaiters, seemed to be trying too hard to be what they once were, to recapture the youth and vitality they had lost. The women, too, seemed to be struggling to maintain their appearance, their high heels and pearl necklaces a desperate attempt to hold on to their beauty in a world that was rapidly passing them by. As one looked closer, one saw that this scene was not just a tableau, but a snapshot of a particular moment in time, a moment when the shells were beginning to crack, when the old men were losing their grip, and when the women were struggling to hold on to their beauty.

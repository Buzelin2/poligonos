‘She had such a lovely smile,’ said Mary Bridger, reflectively. They were
talking, the Bridgers and the Bagots, late one night over the fire about old
friends. This one, Helen Folliott, the girl with the lovely smile, had
vanished. None of them knew what had happened to her. She had come to
grief somehow, they had heard, and, they agreed, each of them had always
known that she would, and, what was odd, none of them had ever forgotten
her.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

Their memories of Helen were like a web of threads, each one tangled in the
others, and yet each one distinct. They remembered her laugh, her eyes,
her way of walking. And yet, they could not quite recall the details of
her face, as if the memory of her was shrouded in a soft, gauzy veil.
It was as if the very essence of her had been distilled into a single
moment, a single gesture, a single look, and yet, they could not quite
pin it down. They knew that she was gone, lost to them forever, but
their memories of her lingered, a bittersweet reminder of the fleeting
nature of life and love.

PERHAPS it was the middle of January in the present that I first looked up and saw the mark on
the wall. In order to fix a date it is necessary to remember what one saw. So now I think of the
fire; the steady film of yellow light upon the page of my book; the three chrysanthemums in the
round glass bowl on the mantelpiece. Yes, it must have been the winter time, and we had just
finished our tea, for I remember that I was smoking a cigarette when I looked up and saw the
mark on the wall for the first time. I looked up through the smoke of my cigarette and my eye
lodged for a moment upon the burning coals, and that old fancy of the crimson flag flapping
from the castle tower came into my mind, and I thought of the cavalcade of red knights riding
up the side of the black rock. Rather to my relief the sight of the mark interrupted the fancy, for
it is an old fancy, an automatic fancy, made as a child perhaps. The mark was a small round
mark, black upon the white wall, about six or seven inches above the mantelpiece.

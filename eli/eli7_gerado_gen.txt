As the ladybird settled on the rail, she noticed a small bird perched on a branch of the mimosa tree, singing a soft, melancholy song. The bird’s melody was a perfect accompaniment to the ladybird’s contemplation of the sunset, and she felt a sudden pang of sadness. It was as if the beauty of the moment was too much to bear, and she felt tears pricking at the corners of her eyes.

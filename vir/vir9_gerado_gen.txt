Like all seaside towns it was pervaded by the smell of fish. The toy shops
were full of shells, varnished, hard yet fragile. Even the inhabitants had a
shelly look - a frivolous look as if the real animal had been extracted on the
point of a pin and only the shell remained. The old men on the parade were
shells. Their gaiters, their riding breeches, their spy glasses seemed to make
them into toys. They could no more have been real sailors or real sportsmen
than the shells stuck onto the rims of photograph frames and looking-
glasses could have lain in the depths of the sea. The women too, with their
trousers and their little high heeled shoes and their raffia bags and their
pearl necklaces seemed shells of real women who go out in the morning to
buy household stores.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

The sea itself seemed to be a shell, a vast conch shell that had washed up
on the shore, its surface glinting and trembling in the sunlight. The
children playing on the beach were like the tiny barnacles that cling to
the shell, their laughter and shouts echoing across the water as they
chased each other and built sandcastles. Even the sky seemed to be a
shell, a great dome of blue that curved over the town and the sea,
protecting them from harm and keeping them safe within its embrace.
As the sun began to set, the shells of the town seemed to glow with a
soft, golden light, as if they had been filled with a radiance from within,
and the sea itself seemed to take on a deeper, more mysterious hue, as if
it were a vast, dark shell that held secrets and mysteries beyond the
understanding of mortal men.

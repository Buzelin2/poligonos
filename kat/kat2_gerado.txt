OH, dear, how she wished that it wasn’t night-time. She’d have much rather
travelled by day, much much rather. But the lady at the Governess Bureau
said: “You had better take an evening boat and then if you get into a
compartment for ‘Ladies Only’ in the train you will be far safer than
sleeping in a foreign hotel. Don’t go out of the carriage; don’t walk about
the corridors and be sure to lock the lavatory door if you go there. The train
arrives at Munich at eight o’clock, and Frau Arnholdt says that the Hotel
Grunewald is only one minute away. A porter can take you there. She will
arrive at six the same evening, so you will have a nice quiet day to rest after
the journey and rub up your German. And when you want anything to eat I
would advise you to pop into the nearest baker’s and get a bun and some
coffee. You haven’t been abroad before, have you?” “No.” “Well, I always
tell my girls that it’s better to mistrust people at first rather than trust them,
and it’s safer to suspect people of evil intentions rather than good ones. . . .

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Katherine Mansfield:

And so, my dear, she found herself on the evening boat, surrounded by
strangers, with only her small valise for company. The air was cool and
damp, and the sound of the engine rumbled beneath her feet as the boat
moved smoothly through the water. She tried to distract herself by reading
the guidebook she had brought with her, but her mind kept wandering back
to the lady at the Governess Bureau and her warnings about the dangers of
travelling alone. She couldn’t shake off the feeling of unease that had
settled in her stomach, and she found herself constantly glancing around
the compartment, searching for any sign of trouble.

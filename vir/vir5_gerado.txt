Nurse Lugton was asleep. She had given one great snore. She had dropped
her head; thrust her spectacles up her forehead; and there she sat by the
fender with her finger sticking up and a thimble on it; and her needle full of
cotton hanging down; and she was snoring, snoring; and on her knees,
covering the whole of her apron, was a large piece of figured blue stuff.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

As she slept, a gentle breeze crept into the room, rustling the curtains and
stirring the air. The flickering candlelight cast eerie shadows on the walls,
illuminating the gentle rise and fall of Nurse Lugton's chest as she breathed.
Despite the stillness of the night, a faint hum filled the air, a low,
mournful melody that seemed to come from the very depths of the nurse's
soul. It was as if the darkness itself had taken on a life of its own, and
was singing a haunting lullaby to the sleeping figure by the fender.

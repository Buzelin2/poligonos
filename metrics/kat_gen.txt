The guests had arrived, the ladies in light-colored dresses, the gentlemen in their Sunday best. They had wandered through the gardens, admiring the flowers and the view, and the sound of their laughter and conversation filled the air. The host and hostess moved among them, smiling and welcoming, making sure that everyone was having a good time. The children played in the garden, chasing each other and picking wildflowers, while the adults sat on the lawn, sipping tea and enjoying the warm sunshine. As the day wore on, the guests began to take notice of the beautiful scenery around them, and they all agreed that it was the perfect setting for a garden-party.

Whatever hour you woke there was a door shunting. From room to room
they went, hand in hand, lifting here, opening there, making sure — a
ghostly couple.
“Here we left it,” she said. And he added, “Oh, but here too!” “It’s
upstairs,” she murmured. “And in the garden,” he whispered “Quietly,” they
said, “or we shall wake them.”

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

And so the ghostly couple continued their rounds, their whispers and
footsteps echoing through the empty rooms. They seemed to be searching
for something, though what it might be they could not quite
remember. As they moved from room to room, the shadows seemed to
lengthen and twist, as if they were alive and writhing on the walls.
The air grew colder and the darkness more profound, until it was
almost as if they were in a different world altogether. And yet, even
as they explored this strange and eerie place, the ghostly couple
could not shake the feeling that they were being watched, that some
unseen force was lurking just beyond the edge of their perception.

Mrs Dalloway said she would buy the gloves herself.
Big Ben was striking as she stepped out into the street. It was eleven
oâ€™clock and the unused hour was fresh as if issued to children on a beach.
But there was something solemn in the deliberate swing of the repeated
strokes; something stirring in the murmur of wheels and the shuffle of
footsteps.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

The sun was shining, casting a golden glow over the city, but Mrs. Dalloway felt a shadow fall across her face as she walked. She glanced up at the sky, and saw a flock of birds flying in formation, their wings beating in unison. It was as if they were performing some sort of ritual, a dance of flight that seemed to mirror the rhythm of her own thoughts. She watched them for a moment, lost in their graceful movements, before turning back to the street. The world was full of beauty, but it was also full of sadness, and Mrs. Dalloway felt the weight of both on her shoulders as she walked.

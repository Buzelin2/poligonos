I got up from my chair and went over to the wall to examine the mark more closely. It was a
small round mark, black upon the white wall, about six or seven inches above the mantelpiece. I
stood there for a moment, staring at it, and then I suddenly felt a cold sweat run down my
back. It was as if something had stirred in the wall, something that was watching me. I
quickly turned away and went back to my chair, feeling a little frightened. But as I sat
down, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was there, watching me. I tried to
distract myself by reading my book, but I couldn't concentrate. The mark on the wall seemed to
be growing larger, and I could feel its presence in the room. I knew then that I had to find
out what it was.

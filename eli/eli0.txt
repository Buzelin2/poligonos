COMING INTO MOHER over the bridge, you may see a terrace of houses by the
river. They are to the left of the bridge, below it. Their narrow height and
faded air of importance make them seem to mark the approach to some
larger town. The six dwellings unite into one frontage, colour-washed
apricot years ago. They face north. Their lower sash windows, front steps
and fanlit front doors are screened by lime trees, making for privacy. There
are area railings. Between them and the water runs a road with a parapet,
which comes to its end opposite the last house.

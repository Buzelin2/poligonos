Mrs Dalloway said she would buy the gloves herself.
Big Ben was striking as she stepped out into the street. It was eleven

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

"The morning air was filled with the scent of blooming flowers and the distant
hum of bees as they flitted from one colorful blossom to the next. Mrs
Dalloway, her eyes fixed on the sky, felt a sense of contentment wash
over her, as if the very fabric of the world was conspiring to bring her
joy. She glanced around her at the bustling streets of London, the people
going about their daily business, and felt a sense of connection to it all,
as if she were a part of something much larger than herself."

THE VICAR MOVED about the chancel in his cassock, thoughtfully
extinguishing the candles. Evensong was over, and the ladies who had
composed the congregation pattered down the aisle and melted away into
the November dusk. At the back of the church somebody was still kneeling;
the Vicar knew that it was the emotional-looking lady in black waiting to
speak to him as he came down to the vestry; he feared this might be a
matter for the confessional and that she might weep. The church was
growing very dark; her black draperies uncertainly detached themselves
from the shadows under the gallery. As he came down towards her, her
white face looked up at him, she made a rustling movement and half rose. A
curious perfume diffused itself around her, through the chilly mustiness of
the pew.

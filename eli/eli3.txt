MR AND MRS TOTTENHAM had come home.
The moist brown gravel of the drive and sweep bore impress of their fly
wheels. Lydia Broadbent listened from the doorstep to the receding gritty
rumble of the empty fly, and the click and rattle as the gate swung to.
Behind her, in the dusky hall, Mr Tottenham shouted directions for the
disposal of the luggage, flustered servants bumped against each other and
recoiled, and Porloch the gardener shouldered the heavy trunks with gasps
and lurches, clutching at the banisters until they creaked.

‘YOU ARE LOSING your imagination,’ cried Maurice.
It was a bitter reproach. He stood over her, rumpling up his hair, and the
wiry tufts sprang upright, quivering from his scalp.
Penelope gulped, then sat for a moment in a silence full of the
consciousness of her brutality. She had never dreamed that her secret
preoccupation would be so perceptible to Maurice. Unconsciously she had
been drawing her imaginations in upon herself like the petals of a flower,
and her emotions buzzed and throbbed within them like a pent-up bee.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

Maurice’s voice, cold and hard, cut through her confusion. ‘You are losing your imagination, Penelope. You used to be so full of ideas and dreams, but now you just sit there, staring into space. What’s happened to you?’

Penelope felt a sting of anger at his accusation, but she knew he was right. She had been withdrawing into herself, losing touch with the world around her. She had been so caught up in her own thoughts and feelings that she had forgotten how to connect with others.

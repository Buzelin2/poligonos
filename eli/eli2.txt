MISS MURCHESON STOPPED AT the corner of the High Street to buy a bunch of
daffodils from the flower-man. She counted out her money very carefully,
pouring a little stream of coppers from her purse into the palm of her hand.
‘— ninepence – ten – eleven – pence halfpenny – a shilling! Thank you
very much. Good afternoon.’

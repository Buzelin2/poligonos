‘She had such a lovely smile,’ said Mary Bridger, reflectively. They were
talking, the Bridgers and the Bagots, late one night over the fire about old
friends. This one, Helen Folliott, the girl with the lovely smile, had
vanished. None of them knew what had happened to her. She had come to
grief somehow, they had heard, and, they agreed, each of them had always
known that she would, and, what was odd, none of them had ever forgotten
her.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

The moon was full, and its silver light streamed through the windows of the Bagots’ house, casting eerie shadows on the walls as they talked. The fire crackled and spat, sending up sparks that danced in the flickering light. Mary Bridger’s eyes seemed to gleam in the dimness, as if she were looking into the depths of some great mystery. ‘I remember her laughter,’ she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ‘It was like a tinkling bell, pure and clear. And her eyes – they were like the stars on a summer night, shining bright and untroubled. I shall never forget her, nor the way she made me feel when she was near. It was as if she had a magic about her, a power to bring light and joy into the world. And now she’s gone, and we’re left with only memories of her loveliness.’

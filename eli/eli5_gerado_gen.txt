MAJENDIE HAD BOUGHT the villa on his honeymoon, and in April, three
months after his death, his widow went out there alone to spend the spring
and early summer. Stuart, who had been in India at the time of Howard
Majendie’s death, wrote to Mrs Majendie before starting for home and her
reply awaited him at his club; he re-read it several times, looking curiously
at her writing, which he had never seen before. The name of the villa was
familiar to him, Majendie had been speaking of it the last time they dined
together; he said it had a garden full of lemon trees and big cypresses, and
more fountains than you could imagine – it was these that Ellaline had
loved. Stuart pictured Mrs Majendie walking about among the lemon trees
in her widow’s black.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

The sound of the sea was incessant, and the air was filled with the scent
of orange blossom and the hum of bees. Mrs Majendie sat on a bench
under a lemon tree, her face turned to the sun, and her hands clasped
together in her lap. She was thinking of her husband, and how he had
spoken of this place with such love and longing, and how she had never
understood why. Now she knew. The villa was a place of peace, a place
where one could escape from the world and its demands, and simply be.
Mrs Majendie felt a sense of peace wash over her, and she closed her
eyes, letting the warmth of the sun soak into her skin. She was grateful
for this place, for the memories it held, and for the chance to be alone
with her thoughts. As she sat there, she knew that she would return to
this place again and again, to remember and to heal.

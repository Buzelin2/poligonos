The Picton boat was due to leave at half-past eleven. It was a beautiful
night, mild, starry, only when they got out of the cab and started to walk
down the Old Wharf that jutted out into the harbour, a faint wind blowing
off the water ruffled under Fenella’s hat, and she put up her hand to keep it
on. It was dark on the Old Wharf, very dark; the wool sheds, the cattle
trucks, the cranes standing up so high, the little squat railway engine, all
seemed carved out of solid darkness. Here and there on a rounded wood-
pile, that was like the stalk of a huge black mushroom, there hung a lantern,
but it seemed afraid to unfurl its timid, quivering light in all that blackness;
it burned softly, as if for itself.

write another paragraph to continue the story that above:

They came to the end of the Old Wharf and turned into a narrow passage
between two high wooden walls, and here the darkness was so complete
that they had to feel their way along, their hands outstretched, as if they
were blind. The passage opened into a small, dimly lit yard, and here they
found the Picton boat, a black shape against the darkness of the water.
Fenella hesitated, feeling for the boat’s rail with her foot, and then
stepped aboard, her heart beating fast with excitement and a little fear.

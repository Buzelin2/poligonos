The sun was shining, a pale, thin sun, but it seemed to be smiling,
as if it were glad to see her out and about. The sky was a soft, pale blue,
the color of a duck’s egg, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of
chrysanthemums. Mrs. Dalloway glanced around her, taking in the sights
and sounds of the city, feeling alive and vital, as if anything was
possible. She walked with a purpose, her eyes fixed on a point in the
distance, her step light and confident. She was a woman on a mission,
determined to make the most of this beautiful day.

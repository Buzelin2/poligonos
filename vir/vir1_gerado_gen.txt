As Stuart Elton stooped and flicked off his trousers a white thread, the
trivial act accompanied as it was by a slide and avalanche of sensation,
seemed like a petal falling from a rose, and Stuart Elton straightening
himself to resume his conversation with Mrs Sutton felt that he was
compact of many petals laid firmly and closely on top of each other all
reddened, all warmed through, all tinged with this inexplicable glow. So
that when he stooped a petal fell. When he was young he had not felt it - no
- now aged forty-five, he had only to stoop, to flick a thread off his trousers,
and it rushed down all through him, this beautiful orderly sense of life, this
slide, this avalanche of sensation, to be at one, when he stood up again
adjusted â€” but what was she saying?

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

Mrs Sutton, with her thin, wispy hair and her eyes that seemed to bore
into his very soul, was speaking of her late husband, Mr Sutton, who had
been a man of great distinction, a man of the world, a man who had known
kings and queens, and Stuart Elton felt a pang of envy, a pang of regret,
as he listened to her words, as he looked into her eyes, and saw there the
glow of a life lived to the full, the glow of a life that had known its share of
joy and sorrow, of triumph and defeat. And as he listened, he felt himself
becoming one with the past, with the present, with the future, as if he were
a thread woven into the great tapestry of life, a thread that would endure
for ever, a thread that would never break.

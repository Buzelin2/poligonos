AT THE CORNER by the fire-station, where Southampton Row is joined by
Theobaldâ€™s Road, a little man, hurrying back to his office after the lunch
hour, was run over by a motor-lorry. He had been stepping backward to
avoid a taxi when worse befell him. What was left of him was taken to
hospital and remained for some days unidentified, as no papers of any sort
were to be found in his pockets.

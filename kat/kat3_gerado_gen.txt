But when they finally did get to the station, and she saw the train
pulling out of the station, she felt a wave of despair. It was as if
everything had been conspiring against them. The hotel, the waiter, the
driver, the change, the boxes, the trainâ€“all of it had been a
combination to keep them from reaching their destination on time. And now
they were left standing there, watching the train disappear into the
distance, with no way of knowing when they would be able to leave again.
It was a feeling she had never experienced before, and it left her
feeling helpless and frustrated.

There was a little dent on the top of the mountain like a crater on the moon.
It was filled with snow, iridescent like a pigeonâ€™s breast, or dead white.
There was a scurry of dry particles now and again, covering nothing. It was
too high for breathing flesh or fur covered life. All the same the snow was
iridescent one moment; and blood red; and pure white, according to the day.

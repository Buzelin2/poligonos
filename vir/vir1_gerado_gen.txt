As Stuart Elton stooped and flicked off his trousers a white thread, the
trivial act accompanied as it was by a slide and avalanche of sensation,
seemed like a petal falling from a rose, and Stuart Elton straightening
himself to resume his conversation with Mrs Sutton felt that he was
compact of many petals laid firmly and closely on top of each other all
reddened, all warmed through, all tinged with this inexplicable glow. So
that when he stooped a petal fell. When he was young he had not felt it - no
- now aged forty-five, he had only to stoop, to flick a thread off his trousers,
and it rushed down all through him, this beautiful orderly sense of life, this
slide, this avalanche of sensation, to be at one, when he stood up again
adjusted â€” but what was she saying?

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

Mrs Sutton was saying, her voice low and gravelly, her eyes fixed on a point beyond Stuart Elton's shoulder, "I've always thought it a great mistake, this tendency to divide things into categories, to label them as this or that. It's so much more interesting to see the connections between things, to find the threads that bind them together." And as she spoke, her words seemed to weave a spell around Stuart Elton, drawing him into a world of subtle connections and intersections, where the petals of life flowed and blended in a delicate dance.

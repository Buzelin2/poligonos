THE VICAR MOVED about the chancel in his cassock, thoughtfully
extinguishing the candles. Evensong was over, and the ladies who had
composed the congregation pattered down the aisle and melted away into
the November dusk. At the back of the church somebody was still kneeling;
the Vicar knew that it was the emotional-looking lady in black waiting to
speak to him as he came down to the vestry; he feared this might be a
matter for the confessional and that she might weep. The church was
growing very dark; her black draperies uncertainly detached themselves
from the shadows under the gallery. As he came down towards her, her
white face looked up at him, she made a rustling movement and half rose. A
curious perfume diffused itself around her, through the chilly mustiness of
the pew.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Elizabeth Bowen:

"Ah, thank you, my dear," the Vicar said, and he bowed over her hand, which
he took in his own, feeling the soft, cold texture of it, and the faint
fragrance of her scent. He led her into the vestry, where the light was
better, and she sat down on the bench, her eyes cast down, her lips
moving in prayer. He stood before her, his hands clasped together, and
listened, as she spoke in a low, tremulous voice, of her husband's death
and her grief, of the darkness that had fallen upon her since, and of her
hope that he might yet hear her prayers and come to her aid. The Vicar
listened, his heart heavy with compassion, and his mind turning over
the words of comfort he might speak. He knew that she was a woman of
great faith, and that she had always been devout in her attendance at
Church, but he also knew that the trials of life had tried her deeply, and
that she had needed to come to him for solace and guidance."

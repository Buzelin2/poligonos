MAJENDIE HAD BOUGHT the villa on his honeymoon, and in April, three
months after his death, his widow went out there alone to spend the spring
and early summer. Stuart, who had been in India at the time of Howard
Majendie’s death, wrote to Mrs Majendie before starting for home and her
reply awaited him at his club; he re-read it several times, looking curiously
at her writing, which he had never seen before. The name of the villa was
familiar to him, Majendie had been speaking of it the last time they dined
together; he said it had a garden full of lemon trees and big cypresses, and
more fountains than you could imagine – it was these that Ellaline had
loved. Stuart pictured Mrs Majendie walking about among the lemon trees
in her widow’s black.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Elizabeth Bowen:

The air was full of the scent of blossoming jasmine and the sound of birdsong, and as she walked through the garden, Mrs Majendie felt a sense of peace that she had not known for many months. It was as if the beauty of the villa and the memories it held had the power to heal her grief, to bring her back to the world of the living. She sat down on a bench beneath a tall cypress tree, and closed her eyes, letting the warmth of the sun on her face and the sound of the birdsong fill her heart with a sense of wonder and awe.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

They passed through rooms filled with memories, their eyes lingering on the objects that had been left behind, the furniture that had seen generations of laughter and tears. In the kitchen, they found a pot of tea that had been left to cool, the cups and saucers arranged on the table as if waiting for a visitor. Outside, the garden was a tangle of wildflowers and weeds, the air thick with the scent of roses and the distant hum of bees. And yet, despite the peacefulness of the scene, there was a sense of restlessness, a feeling that something was about to stir, something that had been sleeping for far too long.

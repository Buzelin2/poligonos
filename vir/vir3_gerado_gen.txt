Lazy and indifferent, shaking space easily from his wings, knowing his
way, the heron passes over the church beneath the sky. White and distant,
absorbed in itself, endlessly the sky covers and uncovers, moves and
remains. A lake? Blot the shores of it out! A mountain? Oh, perfect — the
sun gold on its slopes. Down that falls. Ferns then, or white feathers, for
ever and ever —

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

The heron's eyes, dark as the night, glint in the sun, watching the world below, unmoving, unmoved. For a moment, the wind stirs, and the heron's wings beat once, twice, and then stillness again. The sky, a canvas of blue and white, stretches out before him, endless and unchanging, a mirror to his own unmoving spirit. And yet, there is movement, there is life, in the world below. The trees sway, the flowers bloom, the birds sing their sweet melodies. The heron's eyes flicker, and for a moment, he is caught in their beauty, his heart beating once, twice, before he is lost once more in the eternal stillness of the sky.

They were married. The wedding march pealed out. The pigeons fluttered.
Small boys in Eton jackets threw rice; a fox terrier sauntered across the
path; and Ernest Thorburn led his bride to the car through that small
inquisitive crowd of complete strangers which always collects in London to
enjoy other peopleâ€™s happiness or unhappiness. Certainly he looked
handsome and she looked shy. More rice was thrown, and the car moved
off.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

As they drove away, Ernest and his bride exchanged smiling glances, their
happiness at their union plain to see. The car glided through the city's
streets, the sun shining brightly overhead, casting a golden glow over
their joyful faces. The wind ruffled their hair, and the sound of laughter
and chatter filled the air, as if the very city itself was celebrating
their love. The world seemed to be at peace, and for a moment, it was
as if nothing could ever come between these two, as they embarked on
their life together, hand in hand.

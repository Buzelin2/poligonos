With despair — cold, sharp despair — buried deep in her heart like a
wicked knife, Miss Meadows, in cap and gown and carrying a little baton,
trod the cold corridors that led to the music hall. Girls of all ages, rosy from
the air, and bubbling over with that gleeful excitement that comes from
running to school on a fine autumn morning, hurried, skipped, fluttered by;
from the hollow class-rooms came a quick drumming of voices; a bell rang;
a voice like a bird cried, “Muriel.” And then there came from the staircase a
tremendous knock-knock-knocking. Some one had dropped her dumbbells.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Katherine Mansfield:

Miss Meadows, with a sigh, turned from the door and made her way to her
classroom, her baton clutched tightly in her hand. She had been a teacher
for so many years, and yet the sound of that knock-knock-knocking still
brought a pang to her heart. It was as if the very walls of the school seemed
to be closing in on her, suffocating her with their cold, grey stones. And
yet, she must teach, she must try to inspire these girls with her love of
music, must try to make them see that there was beauty in the world, even
on days like this, when the sky was as grey as the walls of the school. She
opened the classroom door and looked in at her pupils, who were all
gathered around the piano, their faces shining with excitement. “Now,
girls,” she said, her voice a little sharper than usual, “let us begin our
lesson.” And she began to play, her baton moving with a steady, measured
rhythm, her fingers dancing across the keys with a grace and precision
that belied the turmoil that was raging within her.

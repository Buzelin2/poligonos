Lazy and indifferent, shaking space easily from his wings, knowing his
way, the heron passes over the church beneath the sky. White and distant,
absorbed in itself, endlessly the sky covers and uncovers, moves and
remains. A lake? Blot the shores of it out! A mountain? Oh, perfect — the
sun gold on its slopes. Down that falls. Ferns then, or white feathers, for
ever and ever —

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

The heron, a figure of grace and beauty, glides across the sky, its long neck stretched out before it like a silver rod. The sun casts its rays upon the bird's back, illuminating the delicate feathers that ruffle in the breeze. As the heron flies, it leaves behind a trail of light, a shimmering path that lingers in the air like a memory of its passage. The sky itself seems to be alive, pulsating with a gentle rhythm that matches the bird's flight. The heron's wings beat steadily, their movements a symphony of grace and power. It is as if the bird is a messenger from another world, carrying the secrets of the sky on its back and imparting them to the earth below.

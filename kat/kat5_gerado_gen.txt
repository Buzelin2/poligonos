The daughter glanced at her watch and then at her mother, and Mrs. Raddick
knew that she was waiting for something. She herself was waiting, too,
for the daughter to speak, to tell her what it was that she had to say. But
the daughter said nothing, and Mrs. Raddick realized that she would have
to make the first move. "Shall we go in, dear?" she asked, her voice
tentative and polite, as though she were asking the daughter to accompany
her to a funeral. The daughter hesitated, then nodded curtly, and Mrs.
Raddick led the way into the Casino. As they entered, the daughter’s
eyes swept the room with a rapid, impersonal glance, and Mrs. Raddick knew
that she was searching for something. What it was, she couldn’t tell, but
she knew that her daughter was not interested in the other people in the
room, or in the gambling, or in the music. She was searching for
something else, something that she had lost, or never had, and was now
determined to find.

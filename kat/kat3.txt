What if the idiotic hotel people had refused to produce the bill? Wasn’t that
simply because he hadn’t impressed upon the waiter at lunch that they must
have it by two o’clock? Any other man would have sat there and refused to
move until they handed it over. But no! His exquisite belief in human nature

room. . . . And then, when the voiture did arrive, while they were still (Oh,
Heavens!) waiting for change, why hadn’t he seen to the arrangement of the

heat, and point with her parasol? Very amusing picture of English domestic
life. Even when the driver had been told how fast he had to drive he had
paid no attention whatsoever–just smiled. “Oh,” she groaned, “if she’d been
a driver she couldn’t have stopped smiling herself at the absurd, ridiculous
way he was urged to hurry.” And she sat back and imitated his voice:
“Allez, vite, vite “–and begged the driver’s pardon for troubling him. . . .

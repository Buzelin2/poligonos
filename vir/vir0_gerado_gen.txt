PERHAPS it was the middle of January in the present that I first looked up and saw the mark on
the wall. In order to fix a date it is necessary to remember what one saw. So now I think of the
fire; the steady film of yellow light upon the page of my book; the three chrysanthemums in the
round glass bowl on the mantelpiece. Yes, it must have been the winter time, and we had just
finished our tea, for I remember that I was smoking a cigarette when I looked up and saw the
mark on the wall for the first time. I looked up through the smoke of my cigarette and my eye
lodged for a moment upon the burning coals, and that old fancy of the crimson flag flapping
from the castle tower came into my mind, and I thought of the cavalcade of red knights riding
up the side of the black rock. Rather to my relief the sight of the mark interrupted the fancy, for
it is an old fancy, an automatic fancy, made as a child perhaps. The mark was a small round
mark, black upon the white wall, about six or seven inches above the mantelpiece.


write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

I sat there, my eyes fixed upon the mark, my mind in a state of great agitation. I tried to
concentrate upon the book in my hand, but my thoughts kept straying back to the mark on the
wall. I wondered what it could be, this small round mark that seemed to glow with a faint
luminous quality in the flickering light of the fire. I felt a sudden urge to get up and go
closer to it, to examine it more closely, to see if it was some sort of message or sign that had
been left there for me. But I sat there, frozen in my seat, unable to move, my eyes fixed
upon the mark as if it held some secret that I desperately needed to uncover. As the minutes
passed, the mark seemed to grow larger and more vivid, until it filled my entire field of vision,
and I felt as if I was being pulled into it, drawn into a world of mystery and wonder that lay
just beyond the reach of my ordinary senses.

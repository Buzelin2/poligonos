The moon was full, and its silver light streamed through the windows of the Bagots’ house, casting eerie shadows on the walls as they talked. The fire crackled and spat, sending up sparks that danced in the flickering light. Mary Bridger’s eyes seemed to gleam in the dimness, as if she were looking into the depths of some great mystery. ‘I remember her laughter,’ she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ‘It was like a tinkling bell, pure and clear. And her eyes – they were like the stars on a summer night, shining bright and untroubled. I shall never forget her, nor the way she made me feel when she was near. It was as if she had a magic about her, a power to bring light and joy into the world. And now she’s gone, and we’re left with only memories of her loveliness.’

The Picton boat was due to leave at half-past eleven. It was a beautiful
night, mild, starry, only when they got out of the cab and started to walk
down the Old Wharf that jutted out into the harbour, a faint wind blowing
off the water ruffled under Fenella’s hat, and she put up her hand to keep it
on. It was dark on the Old Wharf, very dark; the wool sheds, the cattle
trucks, the cranes standing up so high, the little squat railway engine, all
seemed carved out of solid darkness. Here and there on a rounded wood-
pile, that was like the stalk of a huge black mushroom, there hung a lantern,
but it seemed afraid to unfurl its timid, quivering light in all that blackness;
it burned softly, as if for itself.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Katherine Mansfield:

They came to the end of the wharf, where the boats lay, and the sound of the sea
mingled with the creaking of the cranes, and the snorting of the cattle trucks.
Fenella took her father’s arm, and they stood looking out at the water, where
the Picton boat was just visible, its lights twinkling like the stars above. The
water was black as ink, and the sky was black as the heart of a dark flower.
The wind blew softly, and the sound of the sea was like a low, continuous
moan, as if it were mourning the dead of the war.

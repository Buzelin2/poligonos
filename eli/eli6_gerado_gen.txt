"Ah, Mrs. Pew," he said, bending over her, "what is it? You look troubled.
Let me get you a seat in the vestry and we'll talk." He led her to a
comfortable chair, where she sat, still tremulous, and began to speak in a
low, husky voice, her words tumbling over each other in a rush of
emotion. "It's my daughter, sir. She's been taken ill, and I'm afraid it's
serious. She's been in and out of hospitals for months, and now she's
critical. I've been to see her every day, but she doesn't know me, sir. She
doesn't know anyone. And now she's lying there, so still and so white, and
I can't bear it, sir. I can't bear it."

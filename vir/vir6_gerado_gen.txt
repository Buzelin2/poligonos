They were married. The wedding march pealed out. The pigeons fluttered.
Small boys in Eton jackets threw rice; a fox terrier sauntered across the
path; and Ernest Thorburn led his bride to the car through that small
inquisitive crowd of complete strangers which always collects in London to
enjoy other peopleâ€™s happiness or unhappiness. Certainly he looked
handsome and she looked shy. More rice was thrown, and the car moved
off.

write another paragraph to continue the story above, keeping the style of the story's author, Virginia Woolf:

As they drove through the streets of the city, Ernest and his bride were
surrounded by a kaleidoscope of sights and sounds. The honking of
cars, the chatter of pedestrians, and the wail of sirens created a cacophony
of noise that seemed to swirl around them like a maelstrom. Through it
all, they clung to each other, lost in their own little world of love
and happiness. The car sped along, its wheels humming on the
pavement, as they made their way to their new home, a cozy little flat
in a quiet corner of the city. There, they would begin their life
together, surrounded by the familiar comforts of home and the
promise of a bright and happy future.
